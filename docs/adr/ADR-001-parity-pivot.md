# ADR-001: Pivot from Parity Grinding to Phase 3 (FFI/BLAS/Threading)

## Status

**ACCEPTED** (owner decision 2026-09-05, via bead `deadlock-audit-u2z2b`): revive the three dormant streams rather than close the ADR as partially adopted.

Decision record 2026-09-05: the owner reviewed the state above and ruled to **revive the dormant streams**:
1. **Python packaging** — effectively decided by events: shipped 2026-09-03 (`pyproject.toml` + maturin). Remaining work (PyPI publish) tracked separately; no new stream bead opened.
2. **BLAS/LAPACK linkage** — revived as an opt-in *capability* exploration. Scope note: the suite-wide dependency-smuggling rule still forbids linking C BLAS *to win a benchmark*; the revived stream explores optional linkage for capability/compat surfaces (e.g. LAPACK-only fallbacks for decompositions), never as a benchmark arm, and must not gate the default no-external-C build.
3. **Native i64 GEMM** — revived against the measured 4–7x per-thread wall (docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md, 2026-06-27), which stands as the recorded baseline any attempt must beat or explicitly accept; the integer-BLAS-missing frontier (`int` matmul has no BLAS) is the primary target, per the ledger's own domination analysis.
Implementation beads for streams 2 and 3 are filed in the tracker; SIMD/multi-threading streams remain shipped and closed.

Update 2026-09-03 (reality check): this ADR was never decided, but events decided three of its five streams. **SIMD** and **multi-threading** shipped during the June-July v0.2.0 campaign (`core::simd` kernels, `+avx2` codegen, `rayon` as an unconditional dependency with per-op size gates rather than the feature-gated `parallel` flag proposed below). **Python packaging** landed on 2026-09-03 as `pyproject.toml` + maturin (`pip install .`, Linux / CPython 3.13 verified; no PyPI publish yet). **BLAS/LAPACK linkage** was superseded by the suite-wide rule that forbids linking C BLAS to win a benchmark (`/data/projects/AGENTS.md`, "Dependency smuggling"), and the pure-Rust GEMM was quantified as a 4-7x per-thread wall (docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md, 2026-06-27), with f64 2-D GEMM now delegating to NumPy in the default regime; the "Phase 3 candidate" wording in the README is therefore stale for this stream. **Native i64/u64 arithmetic** has not started: `UFuncArray` still holds `values: Vec<f64>` plus `IntegerSidecar` (ten integer binary ops recompute exactly on the sidecar), while the `fnp_python` fast paths compute integers in native width without touching `UFuncArray`. The decision block below remains for the owner; the practical question left is whether to record the BLAS stream as withdrawn and the native-i64 stream as the one open Phase 3 item.

Update 2026-05-16: The parity track this ADR considered pivoting *away from* has since reached 100% numpy.__all__ coverage (see audit_numpy_reality.md). The proposal's core question — should the project move on to Phase 3 (FFI / BLAS / Threading) — remains open for decision, but the empirical case has changed: the parity surface that looked stalled in April is now complete and structurally locked.

## Context

### Historical State Snapshot (2026-04-10)

This snapshot captured the repo state when the pivot ADR was drafted. It is historical context, not the live tracker or test count; use `bv --robot-triage` and current validation output for present-day counts.
- **9 crates**, ~113K lines of safe Rust, zero `unsafe` blocks
- **~2,960 tests** passing across the workspace
- **372 oracle-verified fixture cases** with 1:1 input/oracle alignment
- **50 beads closed** in the tracker snapshot at the time
- **Stride Calculus Engine (SCE)** operational
- **Dual-mode runtime** (strict/hardened) implemented
- **RaptorQ-everywhere durability** for all artifacts
- **9 Phase2C extraction packets** complete

### Parity Debt Assessment

Recent work (last 17 beads, 2026-04-07/08) shows diminishing returns:
- Early beads added entire op-families (masked arrays, datetime, polynomials)
- Recent beads add 15-24 fixture cases each for narrow edge-case coverage
- Pattern: cross-dtype binops, shift ops, comparison ops, bitwise ops

**Fixture coverage by family:**

| Family | Fixture File | Cases | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| ufunc | ufunc_input_cases.json | 372 | Extensive |
| linalg | linalg_differential_cases.json | 24 | Covered |
| rng | rng_*_cases.json | 4 files | Covered |
| fft | fft_differential_cases.json | Present | Covered |
| io | io_*_cases.json | 3 files | Covered |
| polynomial | polynomial_differential_cases.json | 45KB | Extensive |
| string | string_differential_cases.json | 19KB | Covered |
| datetime | datetime_differential_cases.json | 23KB | Covered |
| masked | masked_differential_cases.json | Present | Covered |
| iter | iter_*_cases.json | 3 files | Covered |

**Remaining gaps:** Primarily edge-case coverage depth, not missing op-families.

### Cross-Engine Performance Gap (from franken_numpy-azql)

First baseline generated 2026-04-10 with 37 workloads:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total workloads | 37 |
| Median ratio | 2.10x (FNP slower) |
| Best ratio | 0.10x (IO: 10x faster!) |
| Worst ratio | 53.60x (div_f64_large) |
| Green band (<=2x) | 17 workloads |
| Yellow band (2-5x) | 9 workloads |
| Red band (>5x) | 11 workloads |

**By op-family:**

| Family | Workloads | Median Ratio | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| io | 2 | 0.14x | **FNP WINS** |
| random | 3 | 1.00x | Parity |
| linalg | 3 | 1.02x | Parity |
| reductions | 7 | 1.18x | Near-parity |
| sorting | 2 | 1.90x | Acceptable |
| statistics | 1 | 2.79x | Yellow |
| matmul | 2 | 3.40x | Yellow |
| fft | 2 | 10.56x | Mixed (power-2 fast, non-power-2 slow) |
| ufunc-broadcast | 6 | 13.53x | **HOTSPOT** |
| ufunc-elementwise | 9 | 30.76x | **CRITICAL HOTSPOT** |

**Root cause of red band:** Binary elementwise operations lack SIMD vectorization. NumPy+OpenBLAS achieves ~2.3ns/element; FNP achieves ~22ns/element on large arrays.

### README's Disclaimed Limitations

The README explicitly defers four capabilities:
1. **Python packaging / drop-in installability** - an early `fnp-python` PyO3 bridge exists, but there is still no `pip install frankennumpy` packaging story or packaged drop-in NumPy replacement.
2. **BLAS/LAPACK backend** - "competitive with BLAS for small matrices; slower for large ones"
3. **Multi-threading** - single-threaded execution
4. **Native i64/u64 > 2^53 arithmetic** - uses f64 intermediary

---

## Decision

**[USER FILLS IN AFTER REVIEW]**

Options:
- **ACCEPT**: Pivot to Phase 3 immediately
- **DEFER**: Continue parity grinding until criteria met
- **MODIFY**: Adjust pivot criteria and re-evaluate

---

## Pivot Criteria (Proposed)

Pivot to Phase 3 when ALL of the following are true:

| Criterion | Threshold | Current | Met? |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------|
| Fixture families with uncovered divergences | < 3 | 0 major gaps | YES |
| Median cross-engine ratio | < 5.0x | 2.10x | YES |
| Test count | > 2,500 | ~2,960 | YES |
| Green+Yellow workloads | > 60% | 70% (26/37) | YES |

**Recommended action:** Criteria are MET. Recommend pivot to Phase 3.

**Note on red-band workloads:** The 11 red-band workloads (binary elementwise at scale) are a known architectural limitation that CANNOT be fixed without SIMD or BLAS - exactly what Phase 3 enables. Grinding more parity debt will not improve these ratios.

---

## Consequences

### Parity Debt Remaining (Acceptable)
- Edge-case coverage in narrow corners (not blocking)
- Non-power-2 FFT optimization (fixable in Phase 3)
- Large-scale elementwise ops (requires Phase 3 SIMD/BLAS)

### New Work Streams for Phase 3

1. **Python packaging and FFI hardening** - package the existing `fnp-python` PyO3 bridge and widen coverage toward drop-in installability
2. **BLAS Backend Integration** - Link OpenBLAS/MKL for linalg hot paths
3. **SIMD Vectorization** - Safe SIMD via `std::simd` (nightly) or `portable_simd`
4. **Multi-threading** - Rayon for parallel reductions/matmul
5. **Native i64/u64 Arithmetic** - Remove f64 intermediary for exact integer ops

### Swarm Reassignment Plan
- **Optimization agents** (w4zs children): Focus on safe-Rust levers first (contiguous fast-paths, tiling)
- **FFI agents**: PyO3 binding layer, Python test harness
- **BLAS agents**: Feature-flagged OpenBLAS linkage behind `unsafe` boundary (isolated, audited)

  - Zero-copy vs copy semantics for array interchange?
  - NumPy buffer protocol support?
  - GIL management strategy?
