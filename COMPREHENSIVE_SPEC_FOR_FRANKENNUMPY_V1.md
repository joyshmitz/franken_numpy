# COMPREHENSIVE_SPEC_FOR_FRANKENNUMPY_V1

## 0. Prime Directive

Build a system that is simultaneously:

1. Behaviorally trustworthy for scoped compatibility.
2. Mathematically explicit in decision and risk handling.
3. Operationally resilient via RaptorQ-backed durability.
4. Performance-competitive via profile-and-proof discipline.

Crown-jewel innovation:

Stride Calculus Engine (SCE): deterministic shape/stride/broadcast legality and zero-copy view guarantees.

Legacy oracle:

- /dp/franken_numpy/legacy_numpy_code/numpy
- upstream: https://github.com/numpy/numpy

## 1. Product Thesis

Most reimplementations fail by being partially compatible and operationally brittle. FrankenNumPy will instead combine compatibility realism with first-principles architecture and strict quality gates.

## 2. V1 Scope Contract

Included in V1:

- ndarray creation/reshape/view/slicing core; - broadcasting and elementwise ufuncs; - reduction basics; - npy/npz core IO.

Deferred from V1:

- long-tail API surface outside highest-value use cases
- broad ecosystem parity not required for core migration value
- distributed/platform expansion not needed for V1 acceptance

## 3. Architecture Blueprint

array API -> shape/stride engine -> ufunc dispatcher -> numeric kernels -> IO

Planned crate families:
- fnp-dtype
- fnp-ndarray
- fnp-ufunc
- fnp-linalg
- fnp-random
- fnp-fft
- fnp-io
- fnp-conformance
- frankennumpy

## 4. Compatibility Model (frankenlibc/frankenfs-inspired)

Two explicit operating modes:

1. strict mode:
   - maximize observable compatibility for scoped APIs
   - no behavior-altering repair heuristics
2. hardened mode:
   - maintain outward contract while enabling defensive runtime checks and bounded repairs

Compatibility focus for this project:

Preserve NumPy-observable shape, broadcast, promotion, and view semantics for scoped operations.

Fail-closed policy:

- unknown incompatible features or protocol fields must fail closed by default
- compatibility exceptions require explicit allowlist entries and audit traces

## 5. Security Model

Security focus for this project:

Harden parser/IO and shape-validation boundaries; prevent malformed shape and unsafe cast pathways.

Threat model baseline:

1. malformed input and parser abuse
2. state-machine desynchronization
3. downgrade and compatibility confusion paths
4. persistence corruption and replay tampering

Mandatory controls:

- adversarial fixtures and fuzz/property suites for high-risk entry points
- deterministic audit trail for recoveries and mode/policy overrides
- explicit subsystem ownership and trust-boundary notes

## 6. Alien-Artifact Decision Layer

Runtime controllers (scheduling, adaptation, fallback, admission) must document:

1. state space
2. evidence signals
3. loss matrix with asymmetric costs
4. posterior or confidence update model
5. action rule minimizing expected loss
6. calibration fallback trigger

Output requirements:

- evidence ledger entries for consequential decisions
- calibrated confidence metrics and drift alarms

## 7. Extreme Optimization Contract

Measure op-family throughput, tail latency, and memory bandwidth efficiency; gate regressions for broadcast and reduction hotspots.

Optimization loop is mandatory:

1. baseline metrics
2. hotspot profile
3. single-lever optimization
4. behavior-isomorphism proof
5. re-profile and compare

No optimization is accepted without associated correctness evidence.

## 8. Correctness and Conformance Contract

Maintain deterministic shape calculus, alias correctness, and dtype promotion table invariants.

Conformance process:

1. generate canonical fixture corpus
2. run legacy oracle and capture normalized outputs
3. run FrankenNumPy and compare under explicit equality/tolerance policy
4. produce machine-readable parity report artifact

Assurance ladder:

- Tier A: unit/integration/golden fixtures
- Tier B: differential conformance
- Tier C: property/fuzz/adversarial tests
- Tier D: regression corpus for historical failures

## 9. RaptorQ-Everywhere Durability Contract

RaptorQ repair-symbol sidecars are required for long-lived project evidence:

1. conformance snapshots
2. benchmark baselines
3. migration manifests
4. reproducibility ledgers
5. release-grade state artifacts

Required artifacts:

- symbol generation manifest
- scrub verification report
- decode proof for each recovery event

## 10. Milestones and Exit Criteria

### M0 — Bootstrap

- workspace skeleton
- CI and quality gate wiring

Exit:
- fmt/check/clippy/test baseline green

### M1 — Core Model

- core data/runtime structures
- first invariant suite

Exit:
- invariant suite green
- first conformance fixtures passing

### M2 — First Vertical Slice

- end-to-end scoped workflow implemented

Exit:
- differential parity for first major API family
- baseline benchmark report published

### M3 — Scope Expansion

- additional V1 API families

Exit:
- expanded parity reports green
- no unresolved critical compatibility defects

### M4 — Hardening

Exit:

- conformance drift zero for V1 scope

## 11. Acceptance Gates

Gate A: compatibility parity report passes for V1 scope.

Gate B: security/fuzz/adversarial suite passes for high-risk paths.

Gate C: performance budgets pass with no semantic regressions.

Gate D: RaptorQ durability artifacts validated and scrub-clean.

All four gates must pass for V1 release readiness.

## 12. Risk Register

Primary risk focus:

Subtle aliasing or promotion bugs hidden behind passing micro-tests.

Mitigations:

1. compatibility-first development for risky API families
2. explicit invariants and adversarial tests
3. profile-driven optimization with proof artifacts
4. strict mode/hardened mode separation with audited policy transitions
5. RaptorQ-backed resilience for critical persistent artifacts

## 13. Immediate Execution Checklist

1. Create workspace and crate skeleton.
2. Implement smallest high-value end-to-end path in V1 scope.
3. Stand up differential conformance harness against legacy oracle.
4. Add benchmark baseline generation and regression gating.
5. Add RaptorQ sidecar pipeline for conformance and benchmark artifacts.

## 20. 90-Day Execution Plan

Weeks 1-2:
- workspace skeleton and dtype/promotion table lock

Weeks 3-5:
- ndarray shape/stride core + strict conformance harness

Weeks 6-8:
- ufunc + broadcast + reductions with first performance baselines

Weeks 9-10:
- parser hardening and adversarial corpora
- strict/hardened runtime policy split with audits

Weeks 11-12:
- full gate topology G1-G6 wired and release-candidate drill

## 21. Porting Artifact Index

This spec is paired with the following methodology artifacts:

1. PLAN_TO_PORT_NUMPY_TO_RUST.md
2. EXISTING_NUMPY_STRUCTURE.md
3. PROPOSED_ARCHITECTURE.md
4. FEATURE_PARITY.md

Rule of use:

- Extraction and behavior understanding happens in EXISTING_NUMPY_STRUCTURE.md.
- Scope, exclusions, and phase sequencing live in PLAN_TO_PORT_NUMPY_TO_RUST.md.
- Rust crate boundaries live in PROPOSED_ARCHITECTURE.md.
- Delivery readiness is tracked in FEATURE_PARITY.md.

## 22. FrankenSQLite Exemplar Alignment (Normative)

The copied exemplar `COMPREHENSIVE_SPEC_FOR_FRANKENSQLITE_V1.md` is normative for methodology quality and artifact rigor.

FrankenNumPy adapts the same style in these mappings:

1. Mode-split discipline:
   - FrankenSQLite `compatibility/native` pattern becomes FrankenNumPy `strict/hardened`.
2. Evidence-first operation:
   - decision events are ledgered for policy-sensitive operations.
3. Gate topology:
   - release readiness is artifact-driven (G1-G6), not narrative-driven.
4. Durability posture:
   - conformance/benchmark/ledger artifacts require sidecar durability contracts.
5. Differential validation:
   - legacy oracle comparison is a mandatory release gate.

## 23. asupersync and frankentui Leverage Plan

FrankenNumPy must leverage both crates as first-class integrations.

### 23.1 asupersync integration responsibilities

- cancellation-safe orchestration for long-running conformance and benchmark jobs
- structured telemetry channel for evidence ledger streaming
- durable pipeline supervision for artifact generation and scrub runs

### 23.2 frankentui integration responsibilities

- live terminal dashboards for parity drift and perf regressions
- interactive strict/hardened divergence inspection views
- operator-facing recovery/audit drill interfaces

### 23.3 enforcement

A release candidate is incomplete if either integration surface is absent or stub-only for all critical workflows.
