## Threat Envelope and Hardened Recovery

- Unknown or incompatible ufunc/gufunc semantics are fail-closed in strict and hardened modes.
- Hardened mode may add bounded validation and audit enrichment, but cannot alter API-visible success/failure class for covered contract rows.
- Recovery behavior remains explicit and deterministic: `allow`, `full_validate`, or `fail_closed`.
- Policy and replay records must include `fixture_id`, `seed`, `mode`, `env_fingerprint`, `artifact_refs`, and `reason_code`.

## Adversarial Fixture Set Definition

| lane | fixture family | objective | owner bead |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fuzz/property | packet-E ufunc signature/override/reduction invariant corpus (planned) | detect parser, precedence, reduction-shape, and loop-registry contract violations | `bd-23m.16.5` |
| Differential/metamorphic | packet-F ufunc/gufunc oracle corpus (planned) | enforce strict parity for dispatch/type-resolution and failure-class behavior | `bd-23m.16.6` |
| E2E/replay | packet-G ufunc dispatch workflow scenarios (planned) | verify strict/hardened replay traceability and policy-forensics linkage | `bd-23m.16.7` |

## Residual Risks and Compensating Controls

| residual_id | residual risk | compensating controls | closure gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `P2C005-RES-01` | `fnp-ufunc` does not yet cover the full legacy dispatch/signature boundary (notably custom-loop semantics). | keep unsupported semantics fail-closed and block parity promotion until packet-D boundary work lands | `bd-23m.16.4` + packet-E baseline tests |
| `P2C005-RES-02` | packet-scoped signature/override/reduction property corpus is incomplete. | require packet-E suite with deterministic shrink/replay logging before parity claims | `bd-23m.16.5` |
| `P2C005-RES-03` | differential coverage for dispatch/type-resolution/loop registry remains incomplete. | enforce packet-F oracle/adversarial fixtures and differential gate coverage | `bd-23m.16.6` |
| `P2C005-RES-04` | packet-scoped replay forensics for ufunc journey paths are not yet fully encoded. | add packet-G scenario logs with required structured fields and reason-code linkage | `bd-23m.16.7` |
| `P2C005-RES-05` | hardened budget/calibration thresholds are now profiled for packet-H hotspot behavior but not tuned for full corpus scale. | use packet-H profile/isomorphism evidence as calibration baseline and keep conservative fallback trigger active until packet-I sign-off | packet-I closure (`artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-005/final_evidence_pack.json`) |

## Budgeted Mode and Decision-Theoretic Controls

### Explicit bounded caps (hardened policy path)

| control | cap | deterministic exhaustion behavior |
|---|---|---|
| signature parse complexity | `<= 2_048` signature tokens/core-dim nodes per request | `fail_closed` with `ufunc_signature_parse_failed` |
| override evaluations | `<= 16` override checks per request | `fail_closed` with audited override budget reason code |
| dispatch candidate evaluations | `<= 512` candidate loop/resolver checks per dispatch | `fail_closed` with `ufunc_dispatch_resolution_failed` |
| reduction validation retries | `<= 64` axis/where validation retries per request | `fail_closed` with `ufunc_reduction_contract_violation` |
| loop registration entries | `<= 256` registration descriptors per request | reject with `ufunc_loop_registry_invalid` |
| packet-local audit payload | `<= 64 MiB` structured event payload | truncate optional diagnostics while preserving mandatory fields |

### Expected-loss model

| state | action set | primary loss if wrong |
|---|---|---|
| ambiguous signature keyword state | `{reject, full_validate}` | incompatible semantics admitted into dispatch pipeline |
| override precedence conflict | `{use_override, use_builtin, reject}` | precedence inversion causing legacy behavior drift |
| uncertain dispatch/type-resolution path | `{resolve, reject}` | non-deterministic loop selection or dtype drift |
| hostile reduction payload | `{accept_reduction, reject}` | silent shape/value corruption in reduction output |
| unknown metadata class | `{fail_closed}` | undefined policy semantics admitted into runtime path |

### Calibration and fallback trigger

- Trigger fallback when either condition is true:
  - strict vs hardened packet failure-class drift exceeds `0.1%`, or
  - unknown/uncategorized reason-code rate exceeds `0.01%`.
- Fallback action: force conservative deterministic behavior (`full_validate` or `fail_closed`) until recalibration artifacts are produced and validated.

### Packet-H calibration artifact

- Profile baseline/rebaseline: `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-005/optimization_profile_report.json`.
- Isomorphism evidence: `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-005/optimization_profile_isomorphism_evidence.json`.
- Workflow replay evidence: `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-005/workflow_scenario_packet005_opt_e2e.jsonl`.
- Workflow forensics index: `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-005/workflow_scenario_packet005_opt_artifact_index.json`.
- Workflow reliability report: `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-005/workflow_scenario_packet005_opt_reliability.json`.
- Current packet-H calibration signal:
  - p95 latency delta `-72.205%`,
  - p95 throughput delta `+259.779%`,
  - failure-class drift `0` across packet-H isomorphism checks,
  - workflow gate replay coverage ratio `1.0` (298/298 scenarios passed).

## Alien Recommendation Contract Mapping

- Graveyard mappings: `alien_cs_graveyard.md` §0.4, §0.19, §6.12.
- FrankenSuite mappings: `high_level_summary_of_frankensuite_planned_and_implemented_features_and_concepts.md` §0.12, §0.13, §0.19.
- EV gate: policy/optimization levers ship only if `EV = (Impact * Confidence * Reuse) / (Effort * AdoptionFriction) >= 2.0`; otherwise explicit deferred parity debt remains.
- Isomorphism proof artifacts required for behavior-affecting changes:
  - ordering/tie-break note,
  - before/after golden parity checks,
  - reproducible benchmark delta artifact.
- Hotspot evidence requirement for non-doc follow-on work: attach baseline/profile artifacts before changing dispatch policy/optimization behavior (or document profiler-unavailable fallback).

## residual_risk_monitoring

owner: `packet-005-maintainers`  
follow_up_gate: `bd-23m.11 readiness drill + packet-I residual risk review`

follow_up_actions:
- expand packet-005 workflow scenario breadth for override and gufunc edge families before readiness sign-off.
- recalibrate hardened dispatch/type-resolution budgets against the full adversarial ufunc corpus and document drift trends.

## Rollback Handle

- Rollback command path: `git restore --source <last-green-commit> -- artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-005/risk_note.md`
- Baseline comparator to beat/restore:
  - last green `rch exec -- cargo run -p fnp-conformance --bin validate_phase2c_packet -- --packet-id FNP-P2C-005` packet report,
  - plus last green security/test/workflow gate artifacts tied to packet `FNP-P2C-005`.
- If comparator is not met, restore risk-note baseline and re-run packet gates before reattempting policy changes.
