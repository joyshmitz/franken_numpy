## compatibility_risks

| risk_id | threat_class | hostile input / abuse vector | strict mode handling | hardened mode handling | control anchors | verification hooks | reason_code family |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `P2C006-RISK-01` | `malformed_shape` | negative dimensions, incompatible target shapes, scalar/non-scalar misuse in broadcast APIs | deterministic rejection with stable failure class | same rejection plus bounded audit context | `security_control_checks_v1.yaml` -> `malformed_shape` | `run_shape_stride_suite`, packet-F differential corpus | `broadcast_to_shape_invalid`, `broadcast_shapes_incompatible` |
| `P2C006-RISK-02` | `malicious_stride_alias` | crafted `as_strided` metadata creating overlapping/unsafe write patterns | preserve legacy class behavior with explicit failure paths where scoped | preserve observable behavior, log overlap-risk decisions, fail-closed on unknown incompatible semantics | `security_control_checks_v1.yaml` -> `malicious_stride_alias` | packet-E unit/property overlap cases + packet-G replay lane | `as_strided_contract_violation` |

## Threat Envelope and Hardened Recovery

- Unknown or incompatible stride/broadcast semantics are fail-closed in strict and hardened modes.
- Hardened mode preserves API-visible outputs while adding bounded validation and explicit audit records for overlap-risk and no-broadcast decision points.
- Policy-mediated outcomes must emit replayable fields: `fixture_id`, `seed`, `mode`, `env_fingerprint`, `artifact_refs`, `reason_code`.
- Recovery behavior is deterministic: either fail-closed, full-validate, or audited bounded handling with no silent repairs.

## Adversarial Fixture Set Definition

| lane | fixture family | objective | owner bead |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fuzz/property | packet-E stride/broadcast invariant corpus (planned) | detect malformed shape, overlap-risk, and no-broadcast invariant violations with shrinkable counterexamples | `bd-23m.17.5` |
| Differential/metamorphic | packet-F oracle corpus for stride-tricks/broadcast API (planned) | enforce strict parity for success/failure classes and shape/readonly outcomes | `bd-23m.17.6` |
| E2E/replay | packet-G stride-tricks + iterator workflow scenarios (planned) | verify strict/hardened replay and forensics traceability in integration paths | `bd-23m.17.7` |

## Residual Risks and Compensating Controls

| residual_id | residual risk | compensating controls | closure gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `P2C006-RES-01` | Full iterator parity (`fnp-iter`) is not implemented yet, increasing risk of silent traversal divergence once integrated. | keep iterator-sensitive semantics explicitly fail-closed where unsupported; require contract-row mapping before implementation | `bd-23m.17.4` + `bd-23m.17.5` |
| `P2C006-RES-02` | High-arity broadcast behavior (`>64` inputs) may drift without dedicated oracle corpora. | add targeted differential corpus and high-arity metamorphic invariants | `bd-23m.17.6` |
| `P2C006-RES-03` | Warning-level compatibility around `broadcast_arrays` writeability path remains subtle/version-sensitive. | lock class/family parity in contract rows and capture explicit reason codes in replay logs | `bd-23m.17.5` + `bd-23m.17.6` |
| `P2C006-RES-04` | Overlap-risk policy for dangerous stride views may regress without integration-level replay. | require packet-G e2e forensics scenarios and strict/hardened comparison logs | `bd-23m.17.7` |
| `P2C006-RES-05` | Hardened budget/calibration thresholds are now profiled for packet-H hotspot behavior but are not yet tuned for full adversarial corpus scale. | use packet-H profile/isomorphism evidence as calibration baseline and keep conservative fallback trigger active until packet-I sign-off | packet-I closure (`artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-006/packet_readiness_report.json`) |

## Budgeted Mode and Decision-Theoretic Controls

### Explicit bounded caps (hardened policy path)

| control | cap | deterministic exhaustion behavior |
|---|---|---|
| broadcast rank merge depth | `<= 1024` dimensions per merge request | `fail_closed` with `broadcast_shapes_incompatible` |
| high-arity broadcast operands | `<= 4096` operands per request | `fail_closed` with `broadcast_shapes_incompatible` |
| overlap-risk validations | `<= 256` overlap decisions per request | `fail_closed` with `as_strided_contract_violation` |
| policy override evaluations | `<= 16` override checks per request | exhaust to conservative default (`fail_closed`) with `override_budget_exhausted` |
| packet-local audit payload | `<= 64 MiB` structured event payload | truncate optional diagnostics while preserving mandatory fields |

### Expected-loss model

| state | action set | primary loss if wrong |
|---|---|---|
| ambiguous broadcast merge semantics | `{merge, reject}` | invalid shape accepted and propagated through downstream iterator paths |
| overlap-risk stride view | `{allow_view, reject_view}` | alias-unsafe write/read behavior admitted |
| warning-level broadcast writeability compatibility | `{legacy_compat_path, reject}` | user-visible warning/error-class drift from legacy behavior |
| unknown metadata class | `{fail_closed}` | undefined policy semantics admitted into runtime path |

### Calibration and fallback trigger

- Trigger fallback when either condition is true:
  - strict vs hardened failure-class drift exceeds `0.1%`, or
  - unknown/uncategorized reason-code rate exceeds `0.01%`.
- Fallback action: force conservative deterministic behavior (`full_validate` or `fail_closed`) until recalibration artifacts are produced and validated.

## residual_risk_monitoring

owner: `packet-006-maintainers`  
follow_up_gate: `bd-23m.11 readiness drill + packet-I residual risk review`

follow_up_actions:
- expand packet-006 workflow scenario breadth for broadcast/stride hostile journeys before readiness sign-off.
- recalibrate hardened broadcast/stride budget thresholds against the full adversarial corpus and document drift trends.

## Rollback Handle

- Rollback command path: `git restore --source <last-green-commit> -- artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-006/risk_note.md`
- Baseline comparator to beat/restore:
  - last green `rch exec -- cargo run -p fnp-conformance --bin validate_phase2c_packet -- --packet-id FNP-P2C-006` packet report,
  - plus last green security/test/workflow gate artifacts tied to packet `FNP-P2C-006`.
- If comparator is not met, restore risk-note baseline and re-run packet gates before reattempting policy changes.
