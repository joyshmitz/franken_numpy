# FNP-P2C-007 Behavior Extraction Ledger

Packet: `FNP-P2C-007-A`  
Subsystem: `RNG core and constructor contract`

## 1. Observable Contract Ledger

| Contract ID | Observable behavior | Strict mode expectation | Hardened mode expectation | Legacy anchors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `P2C007-C01` | `default_rng` normalizes supported seed input classes into deterministic generator construction paths. | deterministic constructor acceptance/rejection for supported seed classes | same outward constructor classes; unknown/incompatible seed metadata fail-closed | `_generator.pyx:4991`, `_generator.pyx:142` |
| `P2C007-C02` | `Generator(bit_generator)` preserves generator/bit-generator identity contracts and serialization hooks. | deterministic bit-generator binding and constructor behavior | same behavior with bounded diagnostics for malformed state payloads | `_generator.pyx:196`, `_generator.pyx:217`, `_generator.pyx:224`, `_generator.pyx:230` |
| `P2C007-C03` | `SeedSequence.generate_state` is deterministic for fixed entropy/spawn-key/pool settings. | identical state words for identical seed-sequence inputs | same output class; malformed seed metadata fail-closed | `bit_generator.pyx:254`, `bit_generator.pyx:407`, `test_seed_sequence.py:6` |
| `P2C007-C04` | `SeedSequence.spawn` deterministically derives child sequences and advances spawn counters predictably. | child spawn-key lineage and counter progression are deterministic | same lineage behavior with bounded audit metadata | `bit_generator.pyx:455`, `bit_generator.pyx:485`, `test_seed_sequence.py:56` |
| `P2C007-C05` | BitGenerator constructors (`MT19937`, `PCG64`, `Philox`, `SFC64`) consume seed inputs via deterministic initialization pathways. | constructor outcomes are stable for fixed seed inputs | same outcomes; malformed seed/state payloads fail-closed | `_mt19937.pyx:130`, `_pcg64.pyx:122`, `_philox.pyx:166`, `_sfc64.pyx:89` |
| `P2C007-C06` | `jumped` APIs yield deterministic partitioned streams/states for fixed input state and jump count. | jumped state parity for each supported algorithm class | same jumped state class with deterministic rejection for malformed jumps | `_mt19937.pyx:213`, `_pcg64.pyx:160`, `_philox.pyx:264`, `test_generator_mt19937.py:2651` |
| `P2C007-C07` | BitGenerator `state` getter/setter roundtrips and invalid-state rejection classes are stable. | valid state roundtrip succeeds; invalid state class rejected predictably | same classes with bounded audit context and deterministic reason codes | `bit_generator.pyx:569`, `bit_generator.pyx:584`, `test_random.py:159` |
| `P2C007-C08` | Pickle/restore flow preserves seed sequence and generator state contracts. | restored generators retain expected seed/state fields | same state-preservation class with fail-closed malformed payload handling | `test_generator_mt19937.py:2790` |

## 2. Compatibility Invariants

1. Constructor determinism invariant: identical constructor inputs must produce equivalent generator class/state outcomes.
2. Seed-sequence determinism invariant: fixed entropy/spawn-key inputs produce identical generated state words.
3. Spawn lineage invariant: parent->child spawn key/counter derivation is deterministic and monotonic.
4. Jump partition invariant: jumped streams/states are deterministic for fixed source state and jump count.
5. State roundtrip invariant: valid state getter/setter roundtrip preserves generator contract; invalid states fail with stable class.
6. Strict/hardened parity invariant: hardened mode may add bounded validation/audit metadata but must preserve public success/failure class for covered contracts.

## 5. Method-Stack Artifacts and EV Gate

- Alien decision contract: RNG policy mediation must record state/action/loss rationale with deterministic fallback behavior.
- Optimization gate: RNG performance changes require baseline/profile + one-lever + behavior-isomorphism proof.
- EV gate: policy/optimization levers ship only when `EV >= 2.0`; otherwise remain explicit deferred parity debt.
- RaptorQ scope: packet-I RNG evidence bundle requires sidecar/scrub/decode-proof linkage for durable artifacts.
- Packet-F closure evidence: `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-007/differential_metamorphic_adversarial_evidence.json` captures RNG differential/metamorphic/adversarial parity and gate wiring status.
- Packet-H closure evidence: `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-007/optimization_profile_report.json` and `optimization_profile_isomorphism_evidence.json` capture a promoted EV decision (`32.0`) with no lookup/isomorphism drift and packet-opt workflow replay proof artifacts.
- Packet-I closure evidence: `fixture_manifest.json`, `parity_gate.yaml`, `parity_report.json`, `parity_report.raptorq.json`, `parity_report.scrub_report.json`, `parity_report.decode_proof.json`, and `final_evidence_pack.json` are now materialized with `packet_readiness_report.json` status `ready`.

## 6. Rollback Handle

If packet-local RNG behavior extraction drifts or is contradicted, revert `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-007/*` to the prior green baseline and re-run packet validation before reapplying changes.
