## Threat Envelope and Hardened Recovery

- Unknown or incompatible RNG semantics are fail-closed in strict and hardened modes.
- Hardened mode may add bounded validation/audit detail, but cannot change packet-visible success/failure class for covered contracts.
- Recovery behavior remains explicit and deterministic: `allow`, `full_validate`, or `fail_closed`.
- Policy/replay records must include `fixture_id`, `seed`, `mode`, `env_fingerprint`, `artifact_refs`, and `reason_code`.

## Adversarial Fixture Set Definition

| lane | fixture family | objective | owner bead |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fuzz/property | packet-E RNG invariant corpus (planned) | detect constructor/state/spawn/jump determinism and schema edge violations | `bd-23m.18.5` |
| Differential/metamorphic | packet-F RNG oracle corpus (implemented) | enforce strict parity for constructor/state/jump witness classes with gate-wired suite evidence | `bd-23m.18.6` |
| E2E/replay | packet-G RNG workflow scenarios (implemented) | verify strict/hardened replay traceability and seed lineage forensics with packet-local artifact indexing and deterministic replay commands | `bd-23m.18.7` |

## Residual Risks and Compensating Controls

| residual_id | residual risk | compensating controls | closure gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `P2C007-RES-01` | `fnp-random` has no concrete constructor/state/spawn/jump implementation yet. | keep unsupported RNG semantics fail-closed and block promotion until packet-D lands | `bd-23m.18.4` + packet-E baseline tests |
| `P2C007-RES-02` | deterministic-seed witness suites are not yet encoded in packet-scoped tests. | require packet-E witness suites before parity claims | `bd-23m.18.5` |
| `P2C007-RES-03` | closed: RNG differential oracle coverage for state schema/jump semantics is implemented and gate-verified. | maintain packet-F fixture families and strict/hardened differential gates; update evidence when fixture families expand | `bd-23m.18.6` closure evidence in `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-007/differential_metamorphic_adversarial_evidence.json` |
| `P2C007-RES-04` | closed: replay forensics for seed lineage is packet-specific for `FNP-P2C-007`. | maintain packet-G scenario logging fields and packet-local workflow artifact index linkage in closure evidence | `bd-23m.18.7` closure evidence in `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-007/e2e_replay_forensics_evidence.json` |
| `P2C007-RES-05` | closed: hardened budget/calibration thresholds were revalidated using packet-H baseline/rebaseline profiling and behavior-isomorphism checks. | maintain packet-H optimization evidence (`optimization_profile_report.json`, `optimization_profile_isomorphism_evidence.json`) and re-run fallback trigger checks during packet-I closure. | `bd-23m.18.8` |

## Budgeted Mode and Decision-Theoretic Controls

### Explicit bounded caps (hardened policy path)

| control | cap | deterministic exhaustion behavior |
|---|---|---|
| constructor normalization attempts | `<= 256` normalization evaluations per request | `fail_closed` with `rng_constructor_seed_invalid` |
| spawn fan-out | `<= 4096` child sequences per spawn request | reject with `rng_seedsequence_spawn_contract_violation` |
| jump operations | `<= 1024` jump operations per fixture replay | abort replay with `rng_jump_contract_violation` |
| state schema validation fields | `<= 4096` schema entries per state payload | reject with `rng_state_schema_invalid` |
| policy override evaluations | `<= 16` override checks per request | fallback to conservative default (`fail_closed`) with audited reason code |
| packet-local audit payload | `<= 64 MiB` structured event buffer | truncate optional diagnostics, preserve mandatory fields |

### Expected-loss model

| state | action set | primary loss if wrong |
|---|---|---|
| ambiguous constructor seed class | `{reject, full_validate}` | nondeterministic initialization admitted as valid constructor path |
| seed sequence lineage mutation | `{accept_spawn, reject_spawn}` | child stream collision / lineage corruption |
| jump request on current state | `{accept_jump, reject_jump}` | stream partition drift and reproducibility loss |
| unknown metadata class | `{fail_closed}` | undefined semantics admitted into RNG policy path |

### Calibration and fallback trigger

- Trigger fallback when either condition is true:
  - strict vs hardened RNG failure-class drift rate exceeds `0.1%`, or
  - unknown/uncategorized RNG reason-code rate exceeds `0.01%`.
- Fallback action: force conservative deterministic path (`full_validate` or `fail_closed`) until recalibration artifacts are produced and validated (`artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-007/optimization_profile_report.json`, `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-007/optimization_profile_isomorphism_evidence.json`).

## Alien Recommendation Contract Mapping

- Graveyard mappings: `alien_cs_graveyard.md` §0.4, §0.19, §6.12.
- FrankenSuite mappings: `high_level_summary_of_frankensuite_planned_and_implemented_features_and_concepts.md` §0.12, §0.13, §0.19.
- EV gate: policy/optimization levers ship only if `EV = (Impact * Confidence * Reuse) / (Effort * AdoptionFriction) >= 2.0`; otherwise explicit deferred parity debt remains.
- Isomorphism proof artifacts required for behavior-affecting changes:
  - ordering/tie-break note,
  - before/after golden parity checks,
  - reproducible benchmark delta artifact.
- Hotspot evidence requirement for non-doc follow-on work: satisfied for packet-H via `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-007/optimization_profile_report.json`; future policy/optimization changes must refresh this evidence (or document profiler-unavailable fallback).

## Rollback Handle

- Rollback command path: `git restore --source <last-green-commit> -- artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-007/risk_note.md`
- Baseline comparator to beat/restore:
  - last green `rch exec -- cargo run -p fnp-conformance --bin validate_phase2c_packet -- --packet-id FNP-P2C-007` packet report,
  - plus last green security/test/workflow gate artifacts tied to packet `FNP-P2C-007`.
- If comparator is not met, restore risk-note baseline and re-run packet gates before reattempting policy changes.
