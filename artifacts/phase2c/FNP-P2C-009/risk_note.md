## Threat Envelope and Hardened Recovery

- Unknown or incompatible IO semantics are fail-closed in strict and hardened modes.
- Hardened mode may add bounded validation and audit enrichment, but cannot alter API-visible success/failure classes for covered contract rows.
- Recovery behavior remains explicit and deterministic: `allow`, `full_validate`, or `fail_closed`.
- Policy/replay records must include `fixture_id`, `seed`, `mode`, `env_fingerprint`, `artifact_refs`, and `reason_code`.

## Adversarial Fixture Set Definition

| lane | fixture family | objective | owner bead |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fuzz/property | packet-E IO parser/roundtrip corpus (planned) | detect header/schema/pickle/memmap/archive contract violations with shrinkable counterexamples | `bd-23m.20.5` |
| Differential/metamorphic | packet-F IO oracle/adversarial corpus (planned) | enforce strict parity for parse/write/dispatch/archive failure-class behavior | `bd-23m.20.6` |
| E2E/replay | packet-G IO workflow scenarios (`io_packet_replay`, `io_packet_hostile_guardrails`) | verify strict/hardened replay traceability and policy-forensics linkage with step-level logs | `bd-23m.20.7` |

## Residual Risks and Compensating Controls

| residual_id | residual risk | compensating controls | closure gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `P2C009-RES-01` | `fnp-io` remains a stub and does not yet implement packet IO boundaries. | keep unsupported IO semantics fail-closed and block parity promotion until packet-D boundary work lands | `bd-23m.20.4` + packet-E baseline tests |
| `P2C009-RES-02` | packet-scoped unit/property parser/roundtrip corpus is incomplete. | require packet-E suite with deterministic shrink/replay logging before parity claims | `bd-23m.20.5` |
| `P2C009-RES-03` | differential/adversarial coverage for malformed metadata and archive edges remains incomplete. | enforce packet-F fixture lanes and differential gate coverage | `bd-23m.20.6` |
| `P2C009-RES-04` | packet-scoped e2e replay now covers golden and hostile IO workflows; remaining risk is breadth expansion across additional user journeys. | maintain packet-G scenario logs/artifact index/evidence links and expand scenario matrix before packet-I closure | `bd-23m.20.7` (`artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-009/e2e_replay_forensics_evidence.json`) |
| `P2C009-RES-05` | hardened budget/calibration thresholds are now profiled for packet-H hotspot behavior but are not yet tuned for full adversarial corpus scale. | use packet-H profile/isomorphism evidence as calibration baseline and keep conservative fallback trigger active until packet-I sign-off | packet-I closure (`artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-009/optimization_profile_isomorphism_evidence.json`) |

## Budgeted Mode and Decision-Theoretic Controls

### Explicit bounded caps (hardened policy path)

| control | cap | deterministic exhaustion behavior |
|---|---|---|
| header parse size | `<= 65_536` bytes unless explicit trusted override lane | `fail_closed` with `io_header_schema_invalid` |
| archive member count | `<= 4_096` members per `.npz` load path | `fail_closed` with `io_npz_archive_contract_violation` |
| archive uncompressed byte budget | `<= 2 GiB` decoded payload per request | abort decode with `io_npz_archive_contract_violation` |
| dispatch retry attempts | `<= 8` branch/policy retries per request | `fail_closed` with `io_load_dispatch_invalid` |
| memmap validation retries | `<= 64` validation checks per request | reject with `io_memmap_contract_violation` |
| packet-local audit payload | `<= 64 MiB` structured event payload | truncate optional diagnostics while preserving mandatory fields |

### Expected-loss model

| state | action set | primary loss if wrong |
|---|---|---|
| ambiguous magic/version prefix | `{reject, full_validate}` | unsupported format admitted into parser route |
| uncertain header schema validity | `{accept_header, reject_header}` | malformed metadata accepted as valid array contract |
| pickle policy conflict | `{allow_pickle_path, reject_pickle_path}` | unsafe object payload execution under disallowed policy |
| archive member anomaly | `{load_member, reject_archive}` | silent archive corruption or key mismatch |
| unknown metadata class | `{fail_closed}` | undefined semantics admitted into runtime path |

### Calibration and fallback trigger

- Trigger fallback when either condition is true:
  - strict vs hardened packet failure-class drift exceeds `0.1%`, or
  - unknown/uncategorized reason-code rate exceeds `0.01%`.
- Fallback action: force conservative deterministic behavior (`full_validate` or `fail_closed`) until recalibration artifacts are produced and validated.

### Packet-H calibration artifact

- Profile baseline/rebaseline: `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-009/optimization_profile_report.json`.
- Isomorphism evidence: `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-009/optimization_profile_isomorphism_evidence.json`.
- Current packet-H calibration signal:
  - p95 latency delta `-45.237%`,
  - p95 throughput delta `+82.604%`,
  - failure-class drift `0` across packet-H isomorphism cases.

## Alien Recommendation Contract Mapping

- Graveyard mappings: `alien_cs_graveyard.md` §0.4, §0.19, §6.12.
- FrankenSuite mappings: `high_level_summary_of_frankensuite_planned_and_implemented_features_and_concepts.md` §0.12, §0.13, §0.19.
- EV gate: policy/optimization levers ship only if `EV = (Impact * Confidence * Reuse) / (Effort * AdoptionFriction) >= 2.0`; otherwise explicit deferred parity debt remains.
- Isomorphism proof artifacts required for behavior-affecting changes:
  - ordering/tie-break note,
  - before/after golden parity checks,
  - reproducible benchmark delta artifact.
- Hotspot evidence requirement for non-doc follow-on work: attach baseline/profile artifacts before changing IO policy/optimization behavior (or document profiler-unavailable fallback).

## residual_risk_monitoring

owner: `packet-009-maintainers`  
follow_up_gate: `bd-23m.11 readiness drill + packet-I residual risk review`

follow_up_actions:
- expand packet-009 workflow scenario breadth beyond current golden/hostile pair before readiness sign-off.
- recalibrate hardened budget thresholds against full adversarial IO corpus and document drift trends.

## Rollback Handle

- Rollback command path: `git restore --source <last-green-commit> -- artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-009/risk_note.md`
- Baseline comparator to beat/restore:
  - last green `rch exec -- cargo run -p fnp-conformance --bin validate_phase2c_packet -- --packet-id FNP-P2C-009` packet report,
  - plus last green security/test/workflow gate artifacts tied to packet `FNP-P2C-009`.
- If comparator is not met, restore risk-note baseline and re-run packet gates before reattempting policy changes.
