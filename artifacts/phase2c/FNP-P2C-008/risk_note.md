## Threat Envelope and Hardened Recovery

- Unknown or incompatible linalg semantics are fail-closed in strict and hardened modes.
- Hardened mode may add bounded validation and audit enrichment, but cannot alter API-visible success/failure classes for covered contract rows.
- Recovery behavior remains explicit and deterministic: `allow`, `full_validate`, or `fail_closed`.
- Policy/replay records must include `fixture_id`, `seed`, `mode`, `env_fingerprint`, `artifact_refs`, and `reason_code`.

## Adversarial Fixture Set Definition

| lane | fixture family | objective | owner bead |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fuzz/property | packet-E linalg invariant corpus (planned) | detect solver/decomposition/spectral/tolerance contract violations with shrinkable counterexamples | `bd-23m.19.5` |
| Differential/metamorphic | packet-F linalg oracle/adversarial corpus (implemented) | enforce strict parity for linalg output/failure-class behavior across golden and hostile cases | `bd-23m.19.6` |
| E2E/replay | packet-G linalg workflow scenarios (implemented) | verify strict/hardened replay traceability and policy-forensics linkage through packet-scoped replay logs and forensics artifact indexes | `bd-23m.19.7` |

## Residual Risks and Compensating Controls

| residual_id | residual risk | compensating controls | closure gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `P2C008-RES-01` | `fnp-linalg` is still skeletal for the full packet boundary surface. | keep unsupported semantics fail-closed and block parity promotion until packet-D boundary work lands | `bd-23m.19.4` + packet-E baseline tests |
| `P2C008-RES-02` | packet-scoped unit/property linalg corpus is incomplete. | require packet-E suite with deterministic shrink/replay logging before parity claims | `bd-23m.19.5` |
| `P2C008-RES-03` | closed: differential/adversarial coverage for singular/non-convergence/tolerance-edge classes is now wired into packet-F suites and gates. | maintain packet-F fixture lanes and differential gate coverage (`linalg_differential`, `linalg_metamorphic`, `linalg_adversarial`). | `bd-23m.19.6` |
| `P2C008-RES-04` | closed: packet-scoped e2e replay for linalg journeys is implemented and audited. | maintain packet-G workflow scenarios + wrapper script and keep `workflow_scenario_packet008_opt_{e2e,reliability,artifact_index}` artifacts fresh with gate runs. | `bd-23m.19.7` |
| `P2C008-RES-05` | closed: hardened budget/calibration thresholds were revalidated using packet-H baseline/rebaseline profiling and behavior-isomorphism checks. | maintain packet-H optimization evidence (`optimization_profile_report.json`, `optimization_profile_isomorphism_evidence.json`) and re-run fallback trigger checks during packet-I closure. | `bd-23m.19.8` |

## Budgeted Mode and Decision-Theoretic Controls

### Explicit bounded caps (hardened policy path)

| control | cap | deterministic exhaustion behavior |
|---|---|---|
| solver/decomposition retry budget | `<= 32` retries per request | `fail_closed` with operation reason code family |
| tolerance-search depth | `<= 128` tolerance evaluations per request | `fail_closed` with `linalg_norm_det_rank_policy_violation` |
| backend bridge revalidation attempts | `<= 64` checks per request | reject with `linalg_backend_bridge_invalid` |
| batched shape validations | `<= 2_000_000` matrix-lane checks per request | abort with `linalg_shape_contract_violation` |
| policy override evaluations | `<= 16` override checks per request | fallback to conservative default (`fail_closed`) with audited reason code |
| packet-local audit payload | `<= 64 MiB` structured event payload | truncate optional diagnostics while preserving mandatory fields |

### Expected-loss model

| state | action set | primary loss if wrong |
|---|---|---|
| ambiguous solver/factorization legality | `{reject, full_validate}` | invalid input admitted causing unstable failure classes |
| singularity uncertainty | `{attempt_solve, reject}` | false-success numerical outputs where failure class should surface |
| spectral branch uncertainty | `{execute_branch, reject}` | incorrect eigenvalue/vector class or masked non-convergence |
| backend seam anomaly | `{bridge_call, reject}` | nondeterministic backend error behavior exposed to API |
| unknown metadata class | `{fail_closed}` | undefined semantics admitted into runtime path |

### Calibration and fallback trigger

- Trigger fallback when either condition is true:
  - strict vs hardened packet failure-class drift exceeds `0.1%`, or
  - unknown/uncategorized reason-code rate exceeds `0.01%`.
- Fallback action: force conservative deterministic behavior (`full_validate` or `fail_closed`) until recalibration artifacts are produced and validated (`artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-008/optimization_profile_report.json`, `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-008/optimization_profile_isomorphism_evidence.json`).

## Alien Recommendation Contract Mapping

- Graveyard mappings: `alien_cs_graveyard.md` §0.4, §0.19, §6.12.
- FrankenSuite mappings: `high_level_summary_of_frankensuite_planned_and_implemented_features_and_concepts.md` §0.12, §0.13, §0.19.
- EV gate: policy/optimization levers ship only if `EV = (Impact * Confidence * Reuse) / (Effort * AdoptionFriction) >= 2.0`; otherwise explicit deferred parity debt remains.
- Isomorphism proof artifacts required for behavior-affecting changes:
  - ordering/tie-break note,
  - before/after golden parity checks,
  - reproducible benchmark delta artifact.
- Hotspot evidence requirement for non-doc follow-on work: satisfied for packet-H via `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-008/optimization_profile_report.json`; future policy/optimization changes must refresh this evidence (or document profiler-unavailable fallback).

## oracle_tests

- `legacy_numpy_code/numpy/numpy/linalg/tests/test_linalg.py`
- `legacy_numpy_code/numpy/numpy/linalg/tests/test_regression.py`
- `legacy_numpy_code/numpy/numpy/linalg/_linalg.py`
- `legacy_numpy_code/numpy/numpy/linalg/umath_linalg.cpp`

## raptorq_artifacts

- `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-008/parity_report.raptorq.json` (planned at packet-I)
- `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-008/parity_report.decode_proof.json` (planned at packet-I)
- `artifacts/raptorq/conformance_bundle_v1.sidecar.json` (program-level baseline reference)
- `artifacts/raptorq/conformance_bundle_v1.scrub_report.json` (program-level baseline reference)
- `artifacts/raptorq/conformance_bundle_v1.decode_proof.json` (program-level baseline reference)

## Rollback Handle

- Rollback command path: `git restore --source <last-green-commit> -- artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-008/risk_note.md`
- Baseline comparator to beat/restore:
  - last green `rch exec -- cargo run -p fnp-conformance --bin validate_phase2c_packet -- --packet-id FNP-P2C-008` packet report,
  - plus last green security/test/workflow gate artifacts tied to packet `FNP-P2C-008`.
- If comparator is not met, restore risk-note baseline and re-run packet gates before reattempting policy changes.
