Method stack: `$porting-to-rust` Phase-2 Deep Extraction + `$alien-artifact-coding` + `$extreme-software-optimization` + RaptorQ durability + frankenlibc/frankenfs strict/hardened doctrine.

## 0. Mission and Completion Criteria

This document defines exhaustive legacy extraction for FrankenNumPy. Phase-2 is complete only when each scoped subsystem has:
1. explicit invariants,
2. explicit crate ownership,
3. explicit oracle families,
4. explicit strict/hardened policy behavior,
5. explicit performance and durability gates.

## 1. Source-of-Truth Crosswalk

Legacy corpus:
- `/data/projects/franken_numpy/legacy_numpy_code/numpy`
- Upstream oracle: `numpy/numpy`

Project contracts:
- `/data/projects/franken_numpy/COMPREHENSIVE_SPEC_FOR_FRANKENNUMPY_V1.md` (sections 14-21)
- `/data/projects/franken_numpy/EXISTING_NUMPY_STRUCTURE.md`

## DOC-PASS-13 Integration Snapshot (2026-02-18)

Packet execution and readiness status snapshot (authoritative for packet closure state in this pass):

| Packet | Parent bead | Bead status | Readiness status | Final evidence pack |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FNP-P2C-001` | `bd-23m.12` | closed | `ready` | `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-001/final_evidence_pack.json` |
| `FNP-P2C-002` | `bd-23m.13` | closed | `ready` | not present (`packet_readiness_report.json` + parity bundle artifacts are present) |
| `FNP-P2C-003` | `bd-23m.14` | closed | `ready` | `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-003/final_evidence_pack.json` |
| `FNP-P2C-004` | `bd-23m.15` | closed | `ready` | `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-004/final_evidence_pack.json` |
| `FNP-P2C-005` | `bd-23m.16` | closed | `ready` | `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-005/final_evidence_pack.json` |
| `FNP-P2C-006` | `bd-23m.17` | closed | `ready` | `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-006/final_evidence_pack.json` |
| `FNP-P2C-007` | `bd-23m.18` | closed | `ready` | `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-007/final_evidence_pack.json` |
| `FNP-P2C-008` | `bd-23m.19` | closed | `ready` | `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-008/final_evidence_pack.json` |
| `FNP-P2C-009` | `bd-23m.20` | closed | `ready` | `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-009/final_evidence_pack.json` |

Interpretation rule for this file during DOC-PASS-13:
- Earlier pass tables that call packet-local F/G/I lanes "missing" are historical pass-time observations.
- This snapshot supersedes those closure-state claims for packet-level status; unresolved items must now point to program-level/doc-level integration debt, not packet completion debt.

### DOC-PASS-13 Consistency Resolution Ledger

| Resolution ID | Prior contradiction pattern | Current resolution status | Remaining owner/closure gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DOC13-R001` | packet-local F/G lane incompleteness for packets `003/005/006/007/008/009` | resolved at packet-level (all closed + `ready` readiness reports) | maintain via `bd-23m.11` readiness drill |
| `DOC13-R002` | stale parent packet bead states (`bd-23m.12/.14/.16/.20`) | resolved (parents closed and synchronized with child closure) | maintain through bead hygiene during future sweeps |
| `DOC13-R003` | no packet-003 final evidence pack generator/artifacts | resolved (`generate_packet003_final_evidence_pack.rs` + packet-003 final artifacts present) | maintain via packet-validator and gate runs |
| `DOC13-R004` | packet-002 final pack asymmetry vs other packets | open | `bd-23m.24.14` (doc exception policy or generator parity decision) |
| `DOC13-R005` | optional-path logging caveat in gate-critical appenders | open | `bd-23m.10` + contract-test tightening (`ARCH-C003`/`RT12-C002`/`RPT16-K005`) |
| `DOC13-R006` | program-level readiness drill had no deterministic sign-off artifact with blocker/waiver classification | resolved with `artifacts/phase2c/phase2c_readiness_drill_report.json` (current run status: `blocked` at `G2`) | `bd-23m.11` until RDY-001/RDY-002/RDY-003 are closed and drill reruns green |

Contradictions/unknowns register (must be closed during doc-overhaul passes):

| ID | Contradiction or unknown | Source/evidence anchor | Owner | Risk | Closure criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DOC-C001` | Historical reduced-scope framing conflict has been removed, but archival pass sections can still read as scope-cut if interpreted without DOC-PASS-13 context. | `EXISTING_NUMPY_STRUCTURE.md` DOC-PASS-13 + historical pass sections | `bd-23m.24.14` | low | Keep DOC-PASS-13 interpretation rule adjacent to legacy pass snapshots and preserve parity-debt wording only. |
| `DOC-C002` | Earlier pass tables still contain pass-time “missing/deferred” lane language that is now superseded by closed packet readiness. | DOC-PASS-13 snapshot + historical pass matrices in both docs | `bd-23m.24.14` | medium | Preserve historical tables but require explicit pass-time labeling and supersession by current snapshot status. |
| `DOC-C003` | Packet `FNP-P2C-002` is `ready` with parity/raptorq artifacts but currently lacks `final_evidence_pack.json`, unlike the other closed packets. | `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-002/*`, packet readiness report, bead status `bd-23m.13` closed | `bd-23m.24.14` | medium | Either add packet-002 final evidence pack generator/artifact or codify an explicit exception policy in readiness doctrine docs. |
| `DOC-C004` | Structured logging contract is strong but known optional-path appender caveats still exist in deep-pass registers (`ARCH-C003`, `RT12-C002`, `RPT16-K005`). | DOC-PASS-12/14/16 contradiction registers + `artifacts/contracts/test_logging_contract_v1.json` | `bd-23m.10` | medium | Move gate-critical appenders from optional-path to fail-closed semantics and enforce with explicit contract tests. |

## DOC-PASS-01 Full Module/Package Cartography with Ownership and Boundaries

### DOC-PASS-01.1 Workspace ownership map (crate -> behavior contract)

| Crate | Ownership boundary (Rust anchors) | Legacy anchor families | Executable evidence anchors | Boundary contract |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fnp-dtype` | `crates/fnp-dtype/src/lib.rs` (`DType`, `promote`, `can_cast_lossless`) | `numpy/_core/src/multiarray/dtypemeta.c`, `descriptor.c`, `can_cast_table.h` | `crates/fnp-conformance/fixtures/dtype_promotion_cases.json`, `crates/fnp-conformance/src/lib.rs` (`run_dtype_promotion_suite`) | Owns deterministic dtype identity/promotion/cast primitives only; does not own array layout, iteration, or execution kernels. |
| `fnp-ndarray` | `crates/fnp-ndarray/src/lib.rs` (`broadcast_shape`, `broadcast_shapes`, `fix_unknown_dimension`, `contiguous_strides`, `NdLayout`) | `numpy/_core/src/multiarray/shape.c`, `shape.h`, stride legality loci | `crates/fnp-conformance/fixtures/shape_stride_cases.json`, `run_shape_stride_suite` | Owns shape/stride legality and contiguous layout calculus; does not own dtype promotion policy or numeric kernels. |
| `fnp-ufunc` | `crates/fnp-ufunc/src/lib.rs` (`UFuncArray`, `BinaryOp`, `elementwise_binary`, `reduce_sum`) | `numpy/_core/src/umath/ufunc_object.c`, reduction/dispatch loop families | `crates/fnp-conformance/src/ufunc_differential.rs`, `ufunc_*` fixtures, `run_ufunc_*` suites | Owns broadcasted elementwise/reduction execution semantics for scoped ops; relies on `fnp-dtype` + `fnp-ndarray` for promotion/layout decisions. |
| `fnp-runtime` | `crates/fnp-runtime/src/lib.rs` (`decide_compatibility*`, `evaluate_policy_override`, `EvidenceLedger`) | Runtime policy doctrine from strict/hardened contract set (fail-closed matrix) | `runtime_policy_cases.json`, `runtime_policy_adversarial_cases.json`, workflow scenario suite | Owns strict/hardened compatibility decisions, fail-closed wire decoding, and policy/audit evidence records; does not own numerical semantics. |
| `fnp-conformance` | `crates/fnp-conformance/src/lib.rs` + submodules (`contract_schema`, `security_contracts`, `test_contracts`, `workflow_scenarios`, `benchmark`, `raptorq_artifacts`, `ufunc_differential`) | Oracle/tests from `legacy_numpy_code/numpy`, packet artifact topology contracts | `run_all_core_suites`, contract/test/security/workflow suites, RaptorQ sidecar/scrub/decode proof tooling | Owns verification and evidence production/validation pipeline; must not redefine core semantics owned by execution crates. |
| `fnp-iter` | `crates/fnp-iter/src/lib.rs` (`TransferSelectorInput`, `select_transfer_class`, `overlap_copy_policy`, `validate_nditer_flags`, `FlatIterIndex`, `TransferLogRecord`) | `numpy/_core/src/multiarray/dtype_transfer.c`, `lowlevel_strided_loops.c.src`, `numpy/_core/src/multiarray/nditer*` | crate unit/property tests + packet refs (`artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-003/fixture_manifest.json`, `parity_gate.yaml`) | Owns transfer selector/overlap policy/flatiter contract checks and packet-003 reason-code taxonomy; packet-local differential/e2e gates are still pending. |
| `fnp-random` | `crates/fnp-random/src/lib.rs` (`DeterministicRng`, `RandomError`, `RandomLogRecord`, bounded/float/state APIs) | `numpy/random/_generator.pyx`, `numpy/random/src/*` | crate unit/property tests + packet refs (`artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-007/fixture_manifest.json`, `parity_gate.yaml`) | Owns deterministic stream/state constructor contracts and replay-log schema for packet-007 first wave; oracle differential and workflow lanes are still pending. |
| `fnp-linalg` | `crates/fnp-linalg/src/lib.rs` (`LinAlgError`, `QrMode`, `solve_2x2`, `svd_output_shapes`, `lstsq_output_shapes`, policy validators, `LinAlgLogRecord`) | `numpy/linalg/lapack_lite/*`, high-level wrappers in `numpy/linalg/*` | crate unit/property tests + packet refs (`artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-008/contract_table.md`, `unit_property_evidence.json`) | Owns linalg shape/solver/mode/tolerance/backend fail-closed contracts for packet-008 first wave; broader parity matrix and differential/e2e lanes remain open. |

### DOC-PASS-01.2 Dependency direction and layering constraints

Workspace dependency graph (from `Cargo.toml` manifests):

1. Foundation leaves: `fnp-dtype`, `fnp-ndarray`, `fnp-iter`, `fnp-random`, `fnp-linalg`, `fnp-io`.
2. Execution layer: `fnp-ufunc` -> (`fnp-dtype`, `fnp-ndarray`).
3. Policy layer: `fnp-runtime` (optional feature links: `asupersync`, `ftui`).
4. Verification layer: `fnp-conformance` -> (`fnp-dtype`, `fnp-ndarray`, `fnp-ufunc`, `fnp-runtime`) + evidence dependencies (`serde*`, `sha2`, `base64`, `asupersync`).

Layering law (non-negotiable for this pass):

- Core semantics flow upward: dtype/shape -> execution -> runtime policy -> conformance/evidence.
- Verification modules may call execution/policy crates, but execution crates must not depend on conformance crates.
- Stub crates (`fnp-iter`, `fnp-random`, `fnp-linalg`, `fnp-io`) are reserved ownership slots; promotion to active owners requires packet A->I evidence artifacts.

Potentially invalid edges to reject:

| Forbidden edge | Why forbidden | Detection/closure |
|---|---|---|
| `fnp-dtype` -> `fnp-ufunc`/`fnp-conformance` | Inverts semantic hierarchy and couples primitives to higher layers | Enforce via manifest review in packet D-stage and contract-schema checks. |
| `fnp-ndarray` -> `fnp-runtime` | Layout legality must remain policy-neutral | Reject in implementation plans (`artifacts/phase2c/*/implementation_plan.md`). |
| Any crate -> `fnp-conformance` (except tests/tools) | Would mix production semantics with oracle/harness code | Gate via Cargo review + `cargo check --workspace --all-targets`. |

### DOC-PASS-01.3 Module hot paths, adapters, and compatibility pockets

| Path | Role type | Why it is a topology hotspot |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/fnp-ndarray/src/lib.rs` (`broadcast_shape`, `fix_unknown_dimension`, `contiguous_strides`) | Hot path | Central SCE legality kernel; every broadcast/reshape legality decision funnels here. |
| `crates/fnp-ufunc/src/lib.rs` (`UFuncArray::elementwise_binary`, `reduce_sum`) | Hot path | Numeric execution path that combines broadcast mapping and reduction index traversal. |
| `crates/fnp-runtime/src/lib.rs` (`decide_compatibility_from_wire`, `decide_and_record_with_context`) | Policy adapter | Converts wire metadata into strict/hardened decisions and audit ledger events. |
| `crates/fnp-conformance/src/ufunc_differential.rs` (`PY_CAPTURE_SCRIPT`, `capture_numpy_oracle`, `compare_against_oracle`) | Oracle adapter/shim | Bridges Rust execution to legacy/system NumPy (or pure fallback) for parity comparisons. |
| `crates/fnp-conformance/src/contract_schema.rs` | Artifact contract validator | Enforces packet artifact topology (`phase2c-contract-v1`) before packet promotion. |
| `crates/fnp-conformance/src/workflow_scenarios.rs` | Integration shim | Links fixture-level checks to E2E scenario corpus and replay logging expectations. |
| `crates/fnp-conformance/src/raptorq_artifacts.rs` | Durability adapter | Generates/validates sidecars, scrub reports, and decode proofs for long-lived evidence bundles. |
| `crates/fnp-iter/src/lib.rs` (`select_transfer_class`, `overlap_copy_policy`, flatiter validators) | Transfer/index hotspot | Encodes packet-003 transfer legality and overlap/broadcast policy checks that future NDIter and stride-tricks paths depend on. |
| `crates/fnp-random/src/lib.rs` (`DeterministicRng::{next_u64,next_f64,bounded_u64,state}`) | RNG hotspot | Encodes deterministic-seed/state semantics and bounded-generation policy for packet-007. |
| `crates/fnp-linalg/src/lib.rs` (shape/solver/qr/svd/lstsq/policy validators) | Linalg contract hotspot | Captures packet-008 fail-closed shape and backend policy semantics that gate solver behavior. |
| `crates/fnp-io/src/lib.rs` (magic/header/descriptor/memmap/load/npz validators) | IO security hotspot | Captures packet-009 parser-budget and contract checks for NPY/NPZ boundary hardening. |
| `crates/fnp-conformance/src/bin/*.rs` gate binaries | Workflow orchestration layer | Operational entrypoints (`run_security_gate`, `run_test_contract_gate`, `run_workflow_scenario_gate`, etc.) that decide what evidence actually ships in CI/gate runs. |

### DOC-PASS-01.4 Verification implications by ownership boundary (covered/missing/deferred)

| Ownership boundary | Unit/Property | Differential | E2E | Structured logging | Status + owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fnp-ndarray` shape/stride legality | covered (crate tests + shape/stride fixtures) | covered (indirect via ufunc differential shape checks), still partial | deferred to packet scenario layers | partial (runtime/workflow logs exist; shape-specific reason taxonomy incomplete) | partial; packet owner `bd-23m.12` |
| `fnp-dtype` promotion/cast primitives | covered (crate tests + promotion fixture suite) | missing full cast-matrix differential | missing packet-level journey | missing per-cast reason-code taxonomy | missing/partial; packet owner `bd-23m.13` |
| `fnp-ufunc` scoped ops (`add/sub/mul/div/sum`) | covered (crate tests + metamorphic/adversarial suites) | covered for scoped fixtures; broader NumPy surface missing | deferred (workflow corpus links exist, packet-local journeys incomplete) | covered at fixture/scenario level | partial; packet owner `bd-23m.17` + `bd-23m.19` |
| `fnp-runtime` strict/hardened policy | covered (crate tests + policy suites) | not applicable as numerical diff; policy-wire adversarial coverage is covered | covered via workflow scenario suite | covered (`fixture_id`,`seed`,`mode`,`env_fingerprint`,`artifact_refs`,`reason_code`) | covered for current surface; continuing under foundation beads `bd-23m.6`, `bd-23m.23` |
| `fnp-iter` transfer/index contracts | covered (unit + property grids in crate tests) | missing packet-local oracle differential lane | missing packet-local journey | covered at record-schema level; not yet gate-enforced | partial; packet owners `bd-23m.14` + `bd-23m.17` |
| `fnp-random` deterministic stream/state | covered (determinism/state/bounded/range tests) | missing dedicated RNG oracle differential lane | missing seed/state replay journey | covered by `RandomLogRecord` schema tests; not yet gate-enforced | partial; packet owner `bd-23m.18` |

### DOC-PASS-01.5 Contradictions and unknowns register (topology-specific)

| ID | Contradiction / unknown | Evidence anchors | Risk | Owner | Closure criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TOPO-C001` | Packet-D boundaries are implemented for `fnp-iter`/`fnp-random`/`fnp-linalg`/`fnp-io`, but `run_all_core_suites` does not yet execute packet-local F/G/H/I lanes for those domains, so topology ownership is only partially exercised in gates. | `crates/fnp-iter/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-random/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-linalg/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-io/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-conformance/src/lib.rs` (`run_all_core_suites`) | high | `bd-23m.17`, `bd-23m.18`, `bd-23m.19`, `bd-23m.20` | Add packet-local differential/e2e/gate wiring (F/G) and include those suites in operational gate paths before claiming full boundary closure. |
| `TOPO-C002` | Differential harness is currently concentrated in ufunc/policy surfaces; packet-specific differential lanes for transfer, RNG, linalg, and IO are not wired. | `crates/fnp-conformance/src/lib.rs`, fixture inventory under `crates/fnp-conformance/fixtures` | high | packet F-stage beads (`bd-23m.14.6`, `bd-23m.18.6`, `bd-23m.19.6`, `bd-23m.20.6`) | Add packet-local fixture manifests, oracle capture paths, and differential report outputs with reason codes. |
| `TOPO-C003` | Layering constraints are documented but not machine-enforced as a workspace contract test. | Root `Cargo.toml` + crate manifests | medium | foundation gate `bd-23m.23` | Add automated dependency-direction check to reliability gate outputs and fail CI on forbidden edges. |
| `TOPO-C004` | Runtime/workflow structured logs are optional via path configuration, allowing silent no-op when env/config is absent. | `set_runtime_policy_log_path`, `set_workflow_scenario_log_path`, `maybe_append_runtime_policy_log` | medium | foundation orchestration `bd-23m.6` | Gate runs must set explicit log paths and fail when required log artifacts are absent. |

### DOC-PASS-02.3 Stability and user-visibility classification

| Tier | Definition | Current symbol groups | Risk if treated as stable too early |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier A | Implemented compatibility-kernel/public semantics used by harness execution | `fnp-dtype`, `fnp-ndarray`, `fnp-ufunc`, `fnp-runtime` public APIs | Medium: behavior is first-wave complete, not full-NumPy complete; parity drift remains possible outside scoped fixtures. |
| Tier B | Operational tooling APIs for CI/gates/artifact lifecycle | `fnp-conformance` public modules and binaries | Medium: interfaces are workflow-stable but still evolving with packet schema/logging requirements. |
| Tier C | Packet-local first-wave boundaries with incomplete gate integration | `fnp-iter`, `fnp-random`, `fnp-linalg`, `fnp-io` public contract APIs | High: APIs exist, but full packet-level differential/e2e/optimization evidence is incomplete, so production parity claims remain invalid. |

### DOC-PASS-02.4 Packet ownership index for unresolved behavior domains (`DOC-C003`)

| Behavior domain | Placeholder surface now | Packet owner | Required closure gates (minimum) | Evidence anchors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NDIter traversal/index semantics | transfer/index boundary APIs in `fnp-iter` (selector, overlap, flatiter validators, logs) | `bd-23m.17` / `FNP-P2C-006` | Extend from packet-D boundary into packet-F/G oracle + replay lanes and integrate into conformance gate workflows | `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-006/*`, `crates/fnp-iter/src/lib.rs` |
| RNG streams + state schema | deterministic RNG/state APIs in `fnp-random` | `bd-23m.18` / `FNP-P2C-007` | Add packet-F/G oracle differential + replay suites and gate wiring; keep deterministic-seed witness artifacts mandatory | `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-007/*`, `crates/fnp-random/src/lib.rs` |
| Linalg adapters/solver contracts | shape/solver/policy contracts in `fnp-linalg` | `bd-23m.19` / `FNP-P2C-008` | Add packet-F/G linalg differential + replay lanes and packet-H optimization/isomorphism evidence | `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-008/*`, `crates/fnp-linalg/src/lib.rs` |

### DOC-PASS-02.5 Verification implications by symbol family

| Symbol family | Unit/Property | Differential | E2E | Structured logging | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shape/stride symbols (`fnp-ndarray`) | covered (crate tests + `shape_stride_cases.json`) | partial through ufunc differential shape validation | deferred packet-local scenarios | partial | parity debt remains for richer alias/transfer semantics |
| Dtype symbols (`fnp-dtype`) | covered for promotion/cast primitives | partial (promotion diff exists, full cast matrix absent) | deferred | missing cast taxonomy | medium risk |
| Ufunc symbols (`fnp-ufunc`) | covered for scoped ops | covered for scoped fixture corpus | partial via workflow suite | covered at fixture/scenario level | medium risk |
| Runtime policy symbols (`fnp-runtime`) | covered (unit + policy fixtures) | adversarial wire-class differential equivalent covered | covered in workflow scenarios | covered with required fields | low-medium risk |
| Verification/tooling symbols (`fnp-conformance`) | covered by module tests and gate execution | N/A | covered by gate binaries | covered by contract suites | medium operational risk (schema evolution) |

### DOC-PASS-02.6 Symbol-layer contradictions and unknowns

| ID | Contradiction/unknown | Risk | Owner | Closure criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SYM-C001` | Tier-C packet-local APIs now exist for iter/random/linalg/io, but gate orchestration still under-represents them compared with ufunc/runtime lanes. | high | `bd-23m.17`/`18`/`19`/`20` | Add packet-local suites to conformance gate execution paths and require parity artifacts before promoting these APIs beyond packet scope. |
| `SYM-C002` | Runtime and workflow log appenders are path-config driven; absent config can silently skip log emission. | medium | `bd-23m.6` | Require explicit log path in orchestrator/gates and fail when expected logs are absent. |
| `SYM-C003` | Differential harness is strongest for ufunc/runtime but weaker for cast matrix, transfer/alias, RNG, linalg, and IO. | high | packet F-stage beads (`bd-23m.14.6`, `bd-23m.18.6`, `bd-23m.19.6`, `bd-23m.20.6`) | Add packet-specific fixture and oracle diff lanes with failure taxonomy and reproducible artifacts. |

### DOC-PASS-03.3 Mutability boundaries and trust zones

| Zone | Mutable surface | Guard rail | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compatibility kernel data | derived vectors/buffers during computation | constructor + precondition checks (shape length, axis bounds, overflow guards) | public struct fields in some models can be mutated after construction if misused |
| Runtime policy ledger | `EvidenceLedger.events` append path | append-only API (`record`) + context normalization | downstream consumers must treat missing logs as gate failure, not optional telemetry |
| File-backed audit logs | runtime/workflow JSONL append | contract suites validate required fields | if log path not configured outside gates, append may no-op |
| Artifact outputs | readiness reports + RaptorQ artifacts | schema/token/path validation + hash checks | stale artifacts can drift without periodic gate enforcement |
| Packet-local first-wave crates | contract-scoped APIs with partial gate integration | explicit packet ownership + contradiction/gap ledgers | overestimating readiness before differential/e2e lanes are integrated |

### DOC-PASS-03.4 Invariant obligations with evidence status

| Invariant | Expression | Evidence status | Logging/e2e implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| `INV-SHAPE-001` | element counts and stride arithmetic never overflow into unchecked state | covered by `fnp-ndarray` unit tests + shape fixtures | errors should map to stable reason taxonomy in packet logs (partial today) |
| `INV-SHAPE-002` | broadcast legality is deterministic and fail-fast on incompatible dimensions | covered for current shape corpus | dedicated broadcast-focused e2e journey still deferred |
| `INV-RESHAPE-001` | reshape `-1` inference is unique and count-preserving | covered by unit tests | packet-local reason-code coverage pending |
| `INV-UFUNC-001` | ufunc construction enforces value length == shape element count | covered by unit tests + differential path | workflow logs capture case/step context for failures |

| `INV-CONTRACT-001` | packet readiness requires mandatory files/tokens/paths | covered by `validate_phase2c_packet` | readiness reports are explicit triage artifacts |
| `INV-DURABILITY-001` | sidecar/scrub/decode artifacts preserve payload integrity | covered for generated bundles | decode proof artifacts are mandatory for durable claim |
| `INV-OWNERSHIP-001` | unresolved domains must have lane-complete packet evidence (unit/property + differential + e2e + logging) before parity claims | partial (models exist; packet-local differential/e2e lanes remain open) | packet owners must close F/G lanes and include evidence in readiness closure artifacts |

### DOC-PASS-03.5 Data-model contradictions and closure backlog

| ID | Contradiction/unknown | Risk | Owner | Closure criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MODEL-C001` | `NdLayout` exposes public fields, so post-construction mutation can violate assumptions outside constructor checks. | medium | `bd-23m.12` | Decide encapsulation policy (public-by-contract vs encapsulated mutators) and enforce consistently. |
| `MODEL-C002` | Runtime/workflow logging optionality can weaken forensic guarantees when not running gates. | medium | `bd-23m.6` | Require explicit log path and gate-level assertion of produced log artifacts in orchestrator flows. |
| `MODEL-C003` | Packet-local state models exist for iter/random/linalg/io, but those models are not yet fully exercised by packet-local differential and workflow replay gates. | high | `bd-23m.17`/`18`/`19`/`20` | Wire packet-local differential/e2e suites into gates and require packet-level readiness artifacts before treating models as parity-complete. |
| `MODEL-C004` | Cast-matrix and transfer/alias invariants are not yet represented as first-class state contracts in code. | high | `bd-23m.13`/`bd-23m.14` | Add explicit state/invariant tables and executable fixtures for cast matrix and overlap/alias transitions. |

## DOC-PASS-04 Execution-Path Tracing and Control-Flow Narratives

### DOC-PASS-04.2 Branch ordering and fallback law (deterministic precedence)

| Branch family | Deterministic ordering rule | Fallback / fail-closed behavior | Why ordering matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| IO payload dispatch (`EP-005`) | Evaluate NPZ magic first, then NPY magic, then pickle (only with explicit allow), else reject | Unknown/forbidden prefixes always map to `io_load_dispatch_invalid` | Prevent ambiguous decode paths and policy bypass via permissive probing. |
| Runtime mode/class decode (`EP-002`, `EP-003`) | Normalize wire mode/class; unknown tokens do not branch into permissive defaults | Unknown metadata maps to fail-closed action and logged reason code | Preserves strict/hardened doctrine under malformed metadata. |
| Ufunc case execution (`EP-001`) | Validate fixture + shape/value consistency before numeric op dispatch | Any precondition failure short-circuits with deterministic mismatch/error output | Avoids undefined behavior from malformed fixtures and preserves oracle comparability. |
| RNG bounded sampling (`EP-006`) | Reject invalid bound first; only then run rejection sampling loop | `upper_bound == 0` hard-fails with stable reason code | Prevents silent modulo-by-zero style divergence and keeps replay deterministic. |
| Linalg mode/convergence (`EP-007`) | Shape/rank preflight -> mode token parse -> convergence predicate | Non-convergence/invalid mode/unknown metadata fail with explicit packet reason codes | Prevents accidental fallback to undefined solver branches. |
| Transfer overlap and flatiter writes (`EP-008`) | Validate context -> determine overlap direction -> enforce index/value arity | Contract violation yields stable transfer reason code and no write admission | Protects alias-sensitive transfer semantics and write-lane safety. |

### DOC-PASS-04.3 Coverage implications by workflow

| ID | Contradiction / unknown | Risk | Owner | Closure criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FLOW-C001` | Packet-local execution paths (`EP-005`..`EP-008`) have deterministic contract tests but are not yet first-class suites in `run_all_core_suites`. | high | `bd-23m.18`, `bd-23m.19`, `bd-23m.20`, `bd-23m.14`/`17` | Add packet-local suites and include them in gate orchestrators. |
| `FLOW-C002` | Workflow/security log appenders are path-config dependent; absent paths can downgrade forensic coverage despite successful test execution. | medium | foundation `bd-23m.6` | Make log path configuration mandatory in gate invocations and fail when expected logs are absent. |
| `FLOW-C003` | Differential harness precedence is ufunc-centric; equivalent branch-level oracle replay is missing for random/linalg/io/transfer paths. | high | packet F-stage beads (`bd-23m.18.6`, `bd-23m.19.6`, `bd-23m.20.6`, `bd-23m.14.6`) | Implement packet-local oracle differentials with per-branch reason-code reporting. |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EP-001` ufunc differential | fixture parse + per-case execution + oracle compare | `O(C * N)` where `C` is case count and `N` is per-case element count | `O(N)` per case for output buffers + report accumulation | `crates/fnp-conformance/src/ufunc_differential.rs`, `crates/fnp-ufunc/src/lib.rs` |
| `EP-002` security gate | finite policy/security suite execution | `O(C)` over configured security/policy fixtures | `O(C)` for suite report/log aggregation | `run_security_gate.rs`, runtime suite functions in `crates/fnp-conformance/src/lib.rs` |
| `EP-003` workflow scenario replay | scenario script execution and expectation checks | `O(S * K)` where `S` is scenario count and `K` is steps per scenario | `O(S + log_entries)` | `workflow_scenarios.rs`, `run_workflow_scenario_gate.rs` |
| `EP-004` packet readiness validation | file existence/schema parse checks | `O(F)` where `F` is required artifact count | `O(F)` for missing-field/readiness structures | `contract_schema.rs`, `validate_phase2c_packet.rs` |
| `EP-005` IO dispatch/validation | magic checks, header/shape validation, budget checks | dispatch is `O(1)`; shape/header checks are `O(rank)`; payload footprint checks are `O(1)` arithmetic | `O(rank)` for copied shape/header descriptors | `crates/fnp-io/src/lib.rs` |
| `EP-006` RNG deterministic generation | splitmix step + optional rejection loop | `next_u64`/`next_f64` are `O(1)`; `bounded_u64` has expected `O(1)` with probabilistic retries | `O(1)` per sample; `fill_u64(len)` is `O(len)` | `crates/fnp-random/src/lib.rs` |
| `EP-007` linalg branch family | shape/mode validation + small-kernel helpers | validators are `O(rank)` or `O(1)`; `solve_2x2` is `O(1)` | mostly `O(1)`; shape outputs are `O(rank)` | `crates/fnp-linalg/src/lib.rs` |

### DOC-PASS-05.2 Memory-growth and allocation behavior

| Path family | Allocation model | Growth driver | Boundedness controls | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fnp-ufunc` elementwise/reduction | allocates output value vectors; keeps input vectors immutable | output element count and dtype width | shape legality and element-count admission checks | high memory pressure for very large broadcasted outputs if fixture caps are weak |
| `fnp-ndarray` layout calculus | shape/stride vectors and small metadata structs | rank and reshape/broadcast rank expansions | overflow checks + rank-aware validation | large-rank adversarial inputs still require explicit fixture budgets |
| `fnp-conformance` reports/artifacts | suite reports + mismatch vectors + artifact JSON outputs | fixture corpus size and number of gate runs | harness config + packet contract validation | artifact accumulation can grow quickly without retention policy |
| `fnp-random` stream generation | constant-state RNG; vector allocation only in `fill_u64` | requested fill length | caller-controlled `len`; deterministic state model | large requested fills can dominate memory unless bounded by caller/gate fixture contracts |
| `fnp-linalg` contract checks | mostly scalar validation and small shape vectors | matrix rank metadata and output-shape tuples | bounded shape checks (`MAX_BATCH_SHAPE_CHECKS`, etc.) | full-matrix numerical kernels (future packet stages) will alter memory profile materially |
| `fnp-io` parser/dispatch contracts | shape/header copies, archive-member name vectors | shape rank, archive member count, metadata size | `MAX_HEADER_BYTES`, `MAX_ARCHIVE_MEMBERS`, byte-budget constants | decoded payload memory growth requires additional end-to-end budget enforcement in replay gates |
| Transfer/index validation (`fnp-iter`) | mostly zero-allocation checks, except caller-provided index structures | mask/fancy index lengths | strict contract validation and fail-fast checks | large index vectors still impose caller-side memory pressure |

### DOC-PASS-05.3 Hotspot inventory and optimization-governance readiness

| Hotspot family | Why hotspot | Baseline/profile artifact status | EV/one-lever governance status | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Broadcasted ufunc loops | `O(N)` numeric kernel path across many fixtures | baseline present (`artifacts/baselines/ufunc_benchmark_baseline.json`) | governance scaffold present; continued per-lever isomorphism artifacts required | `bd-23m.16` |

| Runtime/security/workflow gates | repeated suite execution with log + summary generation | partial (gate summaries/logs exist; cross-gate cost dashboards absent) | add periodic gate-cost snapshots and budget alarms | foundation `bd-23m.8` |
| RNG/linalg/io/transfer packet-local paths | emerging hotspots as packet-local suites scale | missing dedicated benchmark baselines | EV gate cannot be applied consistently until per-path baselines/profiles exist | `bd-23m.14`/`18`/`19`/`20` |
| Artifact durability pipeline | sidecar/scrub/decode proofs scale with bundle size/count | partial (sidecar/scrub/decode artifacts generated; throughput trends not tracked) | needs throughput and storage-growth baselines in optimization reports | packet I + durability owners |

| Shared state surface | Owner module | Mutation API | Synchronization model | Ordering guarantee |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime decision ledger (`EvidenceLedger.events`) | `crates/fnp-runtime/src/lib.rs` | `EvidenceLedger::record` via `&mut self` | Rust exclusive-borrow discipline (`&mut`) | insertion order equals call order within a single ledger instance. |
| Runtime policy log path config | `crates/fnp-conformance/src/lib.rs` | `set_runtime_policy_log_path` | `OnceLock<Mutex<Option<PathBuf>>>` | last successful setter call wins for subsequent append attempts. |
| Shape/stride log path config | `crates/fnp-conformance/src/lib.rs` | `set_shape_stride_log_path` | `OnceLock<Mutex<Option<PathBuf>>>` | last successful setter call wins for subsequent append attempts. |
| Dtype-promotion log path config | `crates/fnp-conformance/src/lib.rs` | `set_dtype_promotion_log_path` | `OnceLock<Mutex<Option<PathBuf>>>` | last successful setter call wins for subsequent append attempts. |
| Workflow scenario log path config | `crates/fnp-conformance/src/workflow_scenarios.rs` | `set_workflow_scenario_log_path` | `OnceLock<Mutex<Option<PathBuf>>>` | last successful setter call wins for subsequent append attempts. |
| Workflow log required-flag | `crates/fnp-conformance/src/workflow_scenarios.rs` | `set_workflow_scenario_log_required` | `OnceLock<Mutex<bool>>` | gate sets true before attempts; guard resets to false on drop. |

### DOC-PASS-06.2 Lifecycle traces (init -> execute -> finalize)

| Lifecycle ID | Initialization | Active phase | Finalization | Failure terminal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LC-001` runtime decision event lifecycle | construct `EvidenceLedger::new` | `decide_and_record_with_context` computes action/posterior/loss and appends event | caller inspects `events()` / `last()` | fail-closed decisions still produce events; malformed context normalized with default tokens. |
| `LC-002` security/test gate attempt lifecycle | parse options, build default harness config, set attempt log path | run suites, summarize attempt, evaluate pass/fail + diagnostics, possibly retry | emit final summary/artifact index; stop on pass or budget exhaustion | deterministic failure/flake-budget/coverage-floor diagnostics in summary artifacts. |
| `LC-003` workflow scenario gate lifecycle | set `workflow_log_required=true`, install drop guard, set attempt log path | run scenario suite; each step emits workflow log entry via append helper; optional retries | drop guard forces `workflow_log_required=false`; summary and diagnostics emitted | if required log path is unset, append helper fails immediately and gate attempt fails deterministically. |
| `LC-004` log append lifecycle (runtime/shape/dtype/workflow) | resolve configured path or env fallback | ensure parent directory exists, open file in append mode, serialize entry, append newline payload | return `Ok(())` after append | path open/create/write errors are surfaced as gate/suite failures. |

### DOC-PASS-06.3 Ordering guarantees (explicitly documented)

| Ordering domain | Guarantee | Anchor |
|---|---|---|
| Decision events | `events` vector preserves append order; `last()` is the most recent recorded decision in that ledger instance. | `EvidenceLedger::record`, `events`, `last` in `crates/fnp-runtime/src/lib.rs` |
| Workflow scenario evaluation | Scenario list is processed in corpus order; each scenario executes `steps` in declared order (`for step in &scenario.steps`). | `run_user_workflow_scenario_suite` and `execute_mode` in `crates/fnp-conformance/src/workflow_scenarios.rs` |
| Gate attempts | Attempt indices are monotonic from `0..=retries` and first successful attempt breaks the loop. | `run_security_gate.rs`, `run_test_contract_gate.rs`, `run_workflow_scenario_gate.rs` |
| Log entries per step | Within one process, log emission follows step execution order and append call sequence for that attempt. | `maybe_append_*log` helpers and per-step calls in conformance/workflow modules |
| Required-log lifecycle | `set_workflow_scenario_log_required(true)` is active during gate run and is reset by drop guard after run exits. | `WorkflowLogRequirementGuard` in `run_workflow_scenario_gate.rs` |

### DOC-PASS-06.4 Race-sensitive and lifecycle-sensitive zones

| Zone | Sensitivity | Current mitigation | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global log-path setters (`OnceLock<Mutex<...>>`) | process-global mutable config can be overwritten by later setter calls | mutex-protected writes/reads avoid data races | semantic interference if multiple gate flows run concurrently in one process and reconfigure shared path slots. |
| Optional runtime/shape/dtype log path behavior | append helper returns `Ok(())` when no path is set | explicit path setting in security/test gate binaries | non-gate or custom invocations may silently skip logs unless enforced externally. |
| Workflow required-log policy | required-flag guards against silent skip in workflow gate | guard + explicit error on missing path | if other callers invoke suite without required flag, missing path can still be treated as non-fatal. |
| File append semantics | append mode preserves payload-at-end writes per call | each append writes serialized line + newline in one `write_all` call | no explicit cross-process file lock; interleaving across separate processes is possible at OS scheduling granularity. |
| Ledger ownership | per-instance mutable ledger avoids shared mutable globals | `&mut` API enforces single mutable accessor in safe Rust | callers needing cross-thread shared ledgers must introduce their own synchronization policy. |

### DOC-PASS-06.5 Verification and logging implications

| Lifecycle area | Unit/Property | Differential | E2E | Structured logging | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime decision ordering | covered by runtime unit tests (event recording + context normalization) | N/A numerical diff; policy-wire behavior covered | covered indirectly via security/workflow gates | covered via runtime policy log entries | strong for single-process sequencing semantics |
| Workflow step ordering and required logs | covered by workflow scenario tests and gate checks | N/A | covered via workflow gate retries and coverage checks | covered with required fields per step | medium risk due shared global path config |
| Gate retry lifecycle | covered in gate binaries through deterministic attempt summary logic | N/A | covered by gate scripts and summaries | attempts include log-path evidence refs | strong for deterministic retry accounting |
| Cross-process append behavior | missing explicit stress/property tests | missing | missing | partial (log lines exist, but interleaving behavior not asserted) | open lifecycle reliability gap |

### DOC-PASS-06.6 Concurrency/lifecycle contradictions and closure register

| ID | Contradiction / unknown | Risk | Owner | Closure criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CONC-C001` | Conformance log path config is global and mutable (`OnceLock<Mutex<Option<PathBuf>>>`), so concurrent in-process gate runs can override each other's destinations. | high | foundation `bd-23m.6`/`bd-23m.23` | move to scoped/log-handle passing or isolate config per run context; add regression test for concurrent invocations. |
| `CONC-C002` | Runtime/shape/dtype append helpers allow silent success when log path is unset, unlike workflow gate required-path mode. | medium | foundation `bd-23m.6` | add mandatory-log mode for all gate-critical appenders or fail gate when expected logs are missing. |
| `CONC-C003` | No explicit end-to-end tests exercise cross-process append contention and ordering stability for JSONL logs. | medium | `bd-23m.7` + docs pass-10 | add stress harness and retention/ordering validation artifacts for log append concurrency. |
| `CONC-C004` | Ordering guarantees are strong inside one process/ledger but not codified as formal contract tests across all packet-local log pipelines. | medium | packet G/I beads | add ordering contract tests and include results in packet readiness evidence packs. |

## DOC-PASS-07 Error Taxonomy, Failure Modes, and Recovery Semantics

### DOC-PASS-07.1 Canonical error taxonomy (code-level anchors)

| Error family | Primary type/registry | Failure class | Typical trigger | Recovery semantics |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shape/stride legality | `ShapeError` (`fnp-ndarray`) | input validation / contract violation | invalid dimension, overflow, incompatible broadcast, out-of-bounds view | fail-fast `Result::Err`; caller must adjust shape/stride inputs. |
| Ufunc execution | `UFuncError` + `UFUNC_PACKET_REASON_CODES` (`fnp-ufunc`) | shape/input/axis contract violation | invalid input length, axis out of bounds, shape merge failures | fail-fast; reason code mapped via `UFuncError::reason_code`. |
| Runtime policy | `DecisionAction::FailClosed` (`fnp-runtime`) | compatibility rejection / fail-closed guard | unknown wire mode/class, known incompatible class, high-risk hardened path | deterministic fail-closed decision and evidence event emission. |
| Transfer/index semantics | `TransferError` + `TRANSFER_PACKET_REASON_CODES` (`fnp-iter`) | selector/overlap/index contract violation | invalid context, lossy same-value cast, overlap policy violations, index mismatch | fail-fast rejection with stable transfer reason code. |
| RNG contract | `RandomError` + `RANDOM_PACKET_REASON_CODES` (`fnp-random`) | bounded-generation contract violation | invalid upper bound (`0`) | deterministic error return; caller must provide valid bound. |
| Linalg contract | `LinAlgError` + `LINALG_PACKET_REASON_CODES` (`fnp-linalg`) | shape/mode/convergence/policy failure | singular solves, invalid qr mode, non-convergence, unknown metadata | fail-fast with packet-specific reason codes; unknown metadata fails closed. |
| IO contract | `IOError` + `IO_PACKET_REASON_CODES` (`fnp-io`) | parser/dispatch/budget/policy failure | bad magic/version, invalid schema/descriptor, memmap/pickle policy violations | fail-fast; unknown metadata and invalid dispatch are rejected fail-closed. |
| Gate reliability diagnostics | `deterministic_failure` / `flake_budget_exceeded` / `coverage_floor_breach` (gate binaries) | orchestration reliability failure | retries exhausted, flake budget exceeded, coverage ratio below floor | gate exits non-zero and emits diagnostics with evidence references. |

### DOC-PASS-07.2 Failure mode matrix (detect -> classify -> act)

| Failure mode | Detection point | Classification channel | Action | Escalation path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Semantic contract mismatch (shape/ufunc/transfer) | crate-level validators and constructors | typed error enum + packet reason code | immediate `Err`, no fallback mutation | fixture/gate failure with case-id context. |
| Unknown compatibility metadata | runtime/linalg/io policy metadata checks | fail-closed action or policy error reason | reject operation (`fail_closed`) | scenario/gate diagnostics + audit/event trails. |
| Log path unset in workflow gate | `maybe_append_workflow_log` with required flag | explicit string error | fail scenario step and gate attempt | retry (if configured), then deterministic_failure diagnostic. |
| Gate suite mismatch | attempt summarization in gate binaries | suite failures + reliability diagnostics | continue until retry budget exhausted or pass | report JSON and exit code `2` on failure. |
| Flaky behavior beyond budget | gate reliability checks (`flake_budget`) | diagnostic reason code `flake_budget_exceeded` | mark gate failed | operator triage with per-attempt log evidence. |
| Coverage below floor | gate reliability checks (`coverage_floor`) | diagnostic reason code `coverage_floor_breach` | mark gate failed | rerun/expand fixture coverage before promotion. |

### DOC-PASS-07.3 Recovery semantics by layer

| Layer | Recovery strategy implemented today | Strategy not implemented (explicit debt) |
|---|---|---|
| Core semantic crates (`fnp-ndarray`, `fnp-ufunc`, `fnp-iter`, `fnp-random`, `fnp-linalg`, `fnp-io`) | deterministic fail-fast errors with typed enums and stable reason codes | no automatic semantic repair/rewrite; intentional to preserve parity observability |
| Runtime policy layer (`fnp-runtime`) | fail-closed defaults on unknown/incompatible semantics; hardened path can escalate to `full_validate` | no probabilistic auto-override without allowlist; intentional safety constraint |
| Conformance suites | per-case failure accumulation with explicit failure messages | packet-local differential/replay lanes still incomplete for some domains |
| Gate binaries | bounded retry loops + flake/coverage diagnostics + evidence refs | adaptive retry policies beyond fixed budgets not implemented |
| Logging/forensics | structured JSONL append with required fields and contract validation | cross-process append contention hardening and strict global log-path isolation pending |

### DOC-PASS-07.4 User-visible vs internal error channels

| Channel | Intended audience | Current format |
|---|---|---|
| `Display` implementations on error enums | developers/operators reading test output and logs | human-readable explanatory strings with key context (axis, expected/actual, policy text) |
| `reason_code` fields and packet reason-code registries | machine gates, analytics, replay tooling | stable tokenized identifiers (`*_contract_violation`, `*_invalid`, `*_fail_closed` families) |
| Gate diagnostics objects | CI/operator pipelines | structured JSON with subsystem, reason_code, message, evidence_refs |
| Workflow/runtime log entries | replay/forensics tooling | structured JSONL rows with fixture/test/mode/env/artifact/reason fields |

### DOC-PASS-07.5 Verification implications for error/recovery semantics

| Domain | Unit/Property | Differential | E2E | Logging-contract coverage | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shape + ufunc + runtime errors | covered | covered for scoped ufunc/runtime lanes | covered in workflow/security/test gates | covered | strong in currently scoped domains |
| Transfer/random/linalg/io errors | covered at crate level | missing packet-local differential lanes | missing packet-local replay lanes | schema-level coverage exists | partial/open integration debt |
| Gate reliability diagnostics | covered by gate logic/tests and execution paths | N/A | covered (gates emit diagnostics) | covered by report JSON + attempt logs | strong |

### DOC-PASS-07.6 Error/recovery contradictions and closure register

| ID | Contradiction / unknown | Risk | Owner | Closure criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ERR-C001` | Error taxonomies exist across packet-local crates, but conformance gate orchestration still emphasizes ufunc/runtime lanes. | high | packet F/G owners (`bd-23m.14.6`, `bd-23m.18.6`, `bd-23m.19.6`, `bd-23m.20.6`) | integrate packet-local differential/replay suites and include their reason-code outcomes in gate summaries. |
| `ERR-C002` | Runtime/shape/dtype log appenders can no-op when path unset, weakening recovery forensics despite errors being generated. | medium | foundation `bd-23m.6` | require mandatory logging mode or explicit gate failure on missing expected logs. |
| `ERR-C003` | Gate retries are fixed-budget and non-adaptive; there is no dynamic policy for repeated transient failures. | medium | foundation `bd-23m.8` | add decision-theoretic retry/escalation strategy with explicit expected-loss justification. |
| `ERR-C004` | Packet readiness reports validate artifact presence but do not yet require exhaustive reason-code coverage proofs for packet-local failure families. | medium | packet I beads + docs pass-10 | add reason-code coverage attestations to packet readiness contracts. |

## DOC-PASS-08 Security/Compatibility Edge Cases and Undefined Zones

### DOC-PASS-08.1 Edge-case boundary matrix (legacy anchor -> Rust boundary -> mode behavior)

| Edge zone | Legacy anchor(s) | Rust anchor(s) | Strict mode expectation | Hardened mode expectation | Evidence status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unknown runtime wire metadata (`mode`/`class`) | no canonical NumPy wire token schema for strict-vs-hardened routing (FrankenNumPy-added contract surface) | `decide_compatibility_from_wire`, `decide_compatibility`, `evaluate_policy_override` (`crates/fnp-runtime/src/lib.rs`) | fail-closed on unknown `mode`/class | fail-closed on unknown `mode`/class; allow override only for known-compatible + allowlisted + hardened path | covered by runtime unit tests + security/test-contract/workflow suites |
| NPY magic/version and header schema ambiguity | `numpy/lib/format.py` and npy/npz readers in `numpy/lib/npyio.py` | `validate_magic_version`, `validate_header_schema`, `validate_read_payload`, `validate_npz_archive_budget` (`crates/fnp-io/src/lib.rs`) | reject invalid magic/version/header and overflowed budgets | same semantic rejection with bounded retry/size controls | covered in `fnp-io` unit tests; gate integration partial |
| Object dtype/pickle dispatch ambiguity | `numpy.load(... allow_pickle=...)` behavior families | `enforce_pickle_policy`, `classify_load_dispatch`, `validate_memmap_contract` (`crates/fnp-io/src/lib.rs`) | reject object payload when pickle policy disallows it | same rejection unless explicit allow path is provided | unit coverage present; packet-local differential/replay still open |
| Reshape `-1`, overflow, and incompatible element-count edge cases | `numpy/_core/src/multiarray/shape.c` contracts | `fix_unknown_dimension`, `element_count`, `contiguous_strides` (`crates/fnp-ndarray/src/lib.rs`) | deterministic error for multiple `-1`, invalid negatives, overflow, or incompatible counts | same | strong unit/property coverage; broad legacy differential expansion still pending |
| Stride-tricks out-of-bounds / negative-stride edge behavior | `numpy/lib/_stride_tricks_impl.py` (`as_strided`, `broadcast_to`) | `NdLayout::as_strided`, `required_view_nbytes`, `NdLayout::broadcast_to` (`crates/fnp-ndarray/src/lib.rs`) | reject out-of-bounds views and negative strides | same | unit coverage present; parity gap remains for negative-stride-compatible legacy cases |
| Iterator overlap/broadcast/write edge behavior | `numpy/_core/src/multiarray/nditer_constr.c`, `nditer_api.c` | `overlap_copy_policy`, `validate_nditer_flags`, `validate_flatiter_*` (`crates/fnp-iter/src/lib.rs`) | reject policy-violating overlap/broadcast/index requests | same | strong unit/property coverage; packet-local differential lane pending |
| Linalg policy metadata/backend bridge boundary | `numpy/linalg/*` operational behavior families | `validate_policy_metadata`, `validate_backend_bridge`, `validate_tolerance_policy` (`crates/fnp-linalg/src/lib.rs`) | fail on unknown metadata/backend unsupported/budget overflow | same; bounded revalidation/tolerance budgets | unit coverage present; packet-local differential/replay lane pending |

### DOC-PASS-08.2 Undefined or ambiguous zones and deterministic FrankenNumPy stance

| Undefined/ambiguous zone | Why this is ambiguous at parity boundary | Current deterministic stance | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tokenized `unknown_semantics` values in packet-local metadata validators | token is syntactically accepted in IO/linalg metadata validators, but semantic meaning is not a legacy-stable allow signal | runtime decision layer remains authoritative and fail-closes unknown/incompatible semantic classes | high |
| Negative-stride `as_strided` behavior breadth | legacy permits nuanced negative-stride view behavior in some pathways | `required_view_nbytes` rejects negative strides (`ShapeError::NegativeStride`) pending explicit parity expansion | high |
| Object-dtype load/memmap policy interaction | legacy behavior depends on payload kind, policy flags, and path | object dtype requires explicit pickle path; object memmap is rejected; unknown dispatch prefixes reject | high |
| NDIter overlap/broadcast interactions under complex flags | legacy C machinery contains many branch-specific diagnostics and transitions | current validator focuses on explicit flag contracts (`no_broadcast`, `copy_if_overlap`) and rejects violations | medium |
| Workflow/gate failure-class taxonomy for novel reason codes | new reason codes may emerge before classifier updates | unknown reason codes currently collapse to generic `scenario_assertion` in workflow gate classification | medium |
| Logging-path optionality outside required workflow mode | some appenders can no-op when path is unset | workflow gate can force required logging; runtime/shape/dtype appenders still have optional-path behavior | medium |

### DOC-PASS-08.3 Security/fault scenario matrix (detect -> contain -> audit)

| Scenario | Primary detection guard | Deterministic containment action | Audit / replay artifact path |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header bomb / malformed NPY payload | `validate_magic_version`, `validate_header_schema`, `validate_read_payload` | fail-fast parse rejection | IO reason codes + packet logs (`io_magic_invalid`, `io_header_schema_invalid`, `io_read_payload_incomplete`) |
| Archive amplification attempt | `validate_npz_archive_budget` member/decoded-size/retry caps | fail-fast budget rejection | IO logs + gate diagnostics |
| Pickle smuggling via ambiguous payload prefix | `classify_load_dispatch` + `enforce_pickle_policy` | reject dispatch unless explicit pickle policy allows | IO reason codes (`io_pickle_policy_violation`, `io_load_dispatch_invalid`) |
| Metadata spoofing / unknown control tokens | `decide_compatibility_from_wire`, `validate_policy_metadata`, `validate_io_policy_metadata` | fail-closed action/rejection | runtime evidence ledger + packet-local policy reason codes |
| Stride alias abuse / view overflow | `required_view_nbytes`, `NdLayout::as_strided`, `broadcast_strides` | reject out-of-bounds or incompatible layouts | ndarray reason-path logs and fixture failures |
| Retry-budget gaming / flaky masking | gate retry loops + `flake_budget` + `coverage_floor` checks | non-zero gate exit with explicit diagnostic reason code | gate report JSON + per-attempt logs + replay command guidance |

### DOC-PASS-08.4 Verification/logging implications for security/compatibility edge zones

| Edge family | Unit/Property | Differential | E2E | Logging/forensics | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime fail-closed metadata handling | covered | covered for runtime suites | covered in security/test/workflow gates | covered via evidence ledger + runtime policy logs | strong |
| IO parser/policy boundedness | covered | partial packet-local differential integration | partial | covered via IO log schemas/reason codes | medium/open integration debt |
| Stride-tricks and reshape undefined zones | covered | partial | partial | covered at test/log level | medium with parity debt |
| Iterator/linalg/random packet-local policy edges | covered | missing packet-local differential lanes | missing packet-local replay lanes | schema-level coverage present | partial/open |
| Gate failure taxonomy and replay guidance | covered | N/A | covered | covered, but unknown reasons currently coarsened | medium |

### DOC-PASS-08.5 Security/compatibility contradictions and closure register

| ID | Contradiction / unknown | Risk | Owner | Closure criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SEC-C001` | Packet-local metadata validators accept tokenized `unknown_semantics`, while runtime doctrine requires semantic fail-closed handling for unknowns. | high | packet F/G owners + foundation `bd-23m.8` | document/encode a single cross-crate rule: unknown semantic class must deterministically map to fail-closed behavior end-to-end. |
| `SEC-C002` | Negative-stride view behavior is currently rejected in ndarray, leaving parity debt against legacy stride-tricks breadth. | high | packet `bd-23m.17` | add explicit legacy parity matrix for negative strides and implement/test contract-compliant branches. |
| `SEC-C003` | Object/pickle load policy is bounded but packet-local differential/replay evidence for hostile payload classes is incomplete. | high | packet `bd-23m.20.6`, `bd-23m.20.7` | add adversarial corpus + workflow replay artifacts proving deterministic policy handling. |
| `SEC-C004` | Optional-path logging for runtime/shape/dtype appenders can weaken forensic completeness in edge failures. | medium | foundation `bd-23m.6` | enforce mandatory logging mode or gate-level missing-log failure checks across all critical appenders. |
| `SEC-C005` | Workflow gate collapses unknown reason-code classes into a generic bucket, reducing triage precision for new failure families. | medium | foundation `bd-23m.23` | expand failure-class taxonomy and require explicit mapping tests for newly introduced reason codes. |
| `SEC-C006` | Iterator/linalg/random packet-local edges are unit/property-covered but not yet gate-backed by full differential/replay suites. | medium | packets `bd-23m.14.6`, `bd-23m.18.6`, `bd-23m.19.6` | complete packet-local differential + replay gates and include outputs in readiness summaries. |

| `XW-C001` | Packet-local crates expose replay-complete log contracts, but corresponding differential/e2e conformance lanes are unevenly integrated. | high | packet F/G owners | require each packet readiness report to include all four lanes: unit/property, differential, e2e, log contract validation. |
| `XW-C002` | Gate reliability tooling is mature for runtime/workflow lanes, but equivalent reliability envelopes are not yet emitted for packet-local lanes. | medium | foundation `bd-23m.23` + packet owners | extend reliability-report pattern to packet-local gates as they are added. |
| `XW-C003` | Crosswalk evidence is currently embedded in docs only; there is no generated machine artifact that CI can diff directly for drift. | medium | docs `bd-23m.24.10` + foundation automation bead | emit crosswalk snapshot JSON as CI artifact and gate schema/version drift. |

## DOC-PASS-10 Expansion Draft (Pass A): Topology and Boundary Narratives

### DOC-PASS-10.1 Layered topology contract (project-level)

| layer_id | Layer | Owned responsibilities | Primary anchors | Allowed dependency direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `L1` | API semantics kernel | dtype/shape/stride/broadcast legality and deterministic view contracts | `crates/fnp-dtype/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-ndarray/src/lib.rs` | inward to pure semantic primitives only |
| `L2` | Execution kernels | transfer/iterator execution classes, ufunc kernels/reductions, packet-local numeric contracts | `crates/fnp-iter/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-ufunc/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-random/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-linalg/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-io/src/lib.rs` | may depend on `L1`; must not mutate conformance/gate state directly |
| `L3` | Runtime policy/audit | strict/hardened decision law, fail-closed semantics, override audit, expected-loss event capture | `crates/fnp-runtime/src/lib.rs` | consumes outputs from `L1/L2`; exposes decision events |
| `L4` | Conformance orchestration | fixture ingestion, suite execution, parity comparison, log normalization/append | `crates/fnp-conformance/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-conformance/src/ufunc_differential.rs`, `crates/fnp-conformance/src/workflow_scenarios.rs` | orchestrates `L1/L2/L3`; owns suite reports |
| `L5` | Gate/reliability + durability artifacts | retry/flake/coverage governance, forensics index, RaptorQ sidecars/scrub/decode proofs | `crates/fnp-conformance/src/bin/run_*_gate.rs`, `crates/fnp-conformance/src/raptorq_artifacts.rs`, `scripts/e2e/run_*_gate.sh` | wraps `L4`; must remain policy-only (no semantic mutation) |

### DOC-PASS-10.2 Boundary narratives (who may call whom, and why)

| Boundary | Narrative | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `L1 -> L2` | semantic legality feeds execution but execution does not redefine legality | execution kernels must treat shape/dtype legality as preconditions and surface typed errors, not reinterpret rules ad hoc |
| `L2/L1 -> L3` | runtime policy evaluates compatibility/risk metadata before action | unknown/incompatible semantics map to fail-closed decisions and auditable events |
| `L3/L2/L1 -> L4` | conformance runs fixtures against semantic + execution + policy layers and emits structured reports | suites normalize `fixture_id/seed/mode/env_fingerprint/artifact_refs/reason_code` for replay |
| `L4 -> L5` | gates consume suite summaries and reliability budgets, then publish deterministic status + diagnostics | retry/flake/coverage controls may classify outcomes but cannot alter semantic verdicts |

### DOC-PASS-10.3 Verification/logging implications by topology layer

| layer_id | Unit/Property | Differential | E2E | Logging contract | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `L1` | strong for ndarray/dtype legality invariants | partial (shape/dtype differential expansion pending) | partial (indirect via workflow gates) | shape/dtype suite logs exist; required-path enforcement not universal | medium |
| `L2` | strong crate-level for ufunc/iter/random/linalg/io | strong for ufunc only; packet-local differential debt in iter/random/linalg/io | partial (runtime/workflow-centric) | packet log-record schemas enforce replay fields | mixed/open |
| `L3` | strong runtime unit + adversarial suites | N/A numeric diff; strong policy fixture differential | strong gate integration | runtime ledger + log-field checks enforced | strong |
| `L4` | strong suite-level validation | strong on integrated suites | strong via workflow scenarios | normalized fields + append helpers | strong with optional-path caveat |
| `L5` | strong gate-bin coverage | N/A | strong scripted replay wrappers (`rch exec -- cargo run ...`) | reliability reports/diagnostics/artifact indices | strong |

### DOC-PASS-10.4 Topology contradictions and closure register

| ID | Contradiction / unknown | Risk | Owner | Closure criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ARCH-C001` | Layer topology is now explicit, but import/build-time guardrails do not yet automatically enforce forbidden cross-layer coupling. | medium | foundation automation follow-up | add static dependency checks (crate-level policy) and gate violations in CI. |
| `ARCH-C002` | `L2` packet-local domains expose log schemas but remain unevenly integrated into `L4/L5` differential and e2e governance lanes. | high | packet F/G owners | promote packet-local lanes into gate suite roster and readiness reports. |
| `ARCH-C003` | Optional-path logging in parts of `L4` can reduce observability guarantees expected by `L5` reliability governance. | medium | `bd-23m.6` + `bd-23m.23` | enforce required-log policy for all gate-critical appenders or fail gate when logs are missing. |

## DOC-PASS-11 Expansion Draft (Pass B): Behavioral and Risk Synthesis

### DOC-PASS-11.1 Behavioral risk concentration map

| domain_id | Behavioral contract core | Dominant failure modes | Blast radius if regressed | Current controls | Residual debt |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BR-001` | shape/stride/broadcast legality | overflow, incompatible broadcast, invalid reshape/view transitions | corrupts nearly all array operations upstream of kernel execution | `ShapeError`-backed checks, shape-stride suite, unit/property invariants | dedicated differential/e2e breadth for full legacy matrix still incomplete |
| `BR-002` | dtype promotion/cast determinism | wrong promotion table resolution, cast policy drift | silent numeric/type drift across all ufunc/linalg/IO paths | dtype promotion suite + registry checks | dedicated dtype-focused differential/e2e gate lane pending |
| `BR-003` | runtime strict/hardened compatibility doctrine | unknown/incompatible metadata not failing closed, override misuse | policy bypass can invalidate security and compatibility guarantees globally | fail-closed decision law + adversarial/runtime suites + gate diagnostics | optional-path logging caveat remains in some appenders |
| `BR-004` | ufunc dispatch/reduction parity | shape/dtype mismatch, reduction axis drift, broadcast dispatch divergence | high user-visible parity break on core numerical path | oracle differential + metamorphic + adversarial suites | standalone ufunc e2e gate wrapper not yet isolated |
| `BR-005` | iterator/transfer/flatiter overlap semantics | overlap policy misclassification, index/write contract breaks | aliasing/assignment corruption in non-contiguous and iterator-heavy paths | packet-local unit/property + reason-code/log schema checks | packet-local differential and replay lanes still open |
| `BR-006` | RNG deterministic stream/state schema | seed/state drift, bounded generation policy violation | reproducibility and scientific repeatability failures | deterministic/state tests + log schema checks | packet-local differential/replay gate integration pending |
| `BR-007` | linalg policy/shape/convergence contracts | mode-policy mismatch, solver/shape contract violations | high-severity numerical correctness and stability risk | packet-local unit/property + reason-code/log schema checks | packet-local differential/replay gate integration pending |
| `BR-008` | IO parser/dispatch/policy boundaries | malformed payload acceptance, pickle/memmap policy drift, budget bypass | security and data-integrity risk at ingestion boundary | bounded validators + reason-code/log schema checks | packet-local differential/replay gate integration pending |

### DOC-PASS-11.2 Compatibility drift sentinel matrix

| sentinel_id | Drift signal | Detection lane | Trigger threshold | Escalation action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SEN-001` | fail-closed violations on unknown/incompatible semantics | runtime ledger checks (`validate_runtime_policy_log_fields`) + gate diagnostics | any non-zero occurrence | immediate gate fail; block promotion and open high-priority incident bead |
| `SEN-002` | ufunc parity mismatches vs oracle | `run_ufunc_differential_suite` report failures | any mismatch in required family | fail build lane; require minimized repro and reason-code mapping update |
| `SEN-003` | flake/coverage reliability drift | gate reliability diagnostics (`flake_budget_exceeded`, `coverage_floor_breach`) | over configured budget/floor | block merge; replay via emitted command and update corpus/fixtures |
| `SEN-004` | missing replay-complete log fields | `run_test_contract_gate` log validator + packet log-record validators | any required-field miss | fail test-contract gate and require logging contract remediation |
| `SEN-005` | packet-local lane incompleteness at readiness | packet readiness reports vs crosswalk `GAP-XW-*` | any missing required lane at closure | disallow packet closure until lane-evidence checklist is complete |

### DOC-PASS-11.3 Budgeted-control and expected-loss integration status

| control_surface | Budgeted behavior implemented | Expected-loss / decision-theoretic status | Gap owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| runtime policy decisions | yes (`hardened_validation_threshold`, fail-closed routing, expected-loss fields in events) | implemented in runtime decision events | foundation maintained |
| gate retry/flake/coverage governance | yes (explicit retries, flake budget, coverage floor) | heuristic thresholds currently dominate; expected-loss escalation policy not unified | `bd-23m.8`, `bd-23m.23` |
| packet-local parser/solver budgets | partial (IO/linalg bounded retries/search depth/cap checks) | mostly threshold-based guards; unified loss-based escalation not yet encoded | packet owners + foundation policy |

### DOC-PASS-11.4 Verification/logging implications for pass-B synthesis

| synthesis_area | Unit/Property | Differential | E2E | Logging/forensics | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Core semantic/kernel concentration (`BR-001..BR-004`) | strong | strong for ufunc/runtime, partial for shape/dtype | strong for runtime/workflow lanes | strong with known optional-path caveat | medium-strong |
| Packet-local risk concentration (`BR-005..BR-008`) | strong crate-level | missing packet-local differential lanes | missing packet-local replay lanes | strong schema-level, weaker gate integration | partial/open |
| Reliability sentinel framework (`SEN-*`) | strong gate-bin/test coverage | N/A | strong for security/test/workflow/raptorq gate runners | strong diagnostics + replay-command linkage | strong |

### DOC-PASS-11.5 Behavioral/risk synthesis contradictions and closure register

| ID | Contradiction / unknown | Risk | Owner | Closure criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SYN-C001` | Risk concentration is known for packet-local domains, but lane completeness remains inconsistent at readiness time. | high | packet F/G owners | require lane-complete checklist enforcement in packet readiness gate. |
| `SYN-C002` | Runtime uses expected-loss annotations, but gate escalation strategy is still primarily threshold-driven. | medium | `bd-23m.8` + `bd-23m.23` | add explicit expected-loss-based escalation policy for reliability gates. |
| `SYN-C003` | Cross-cut sentinel set is documented, but no single generated artifact currently tracks sentinel status over time. | medium | docs automation follow-up | emit sentinel snapshot artifact per gate run and trend it in CI. |

## DOC-PASS-12 Independent Red-Team Contradiction and Completeness Review

### DOC-PASS-12.1 Adversarial findings ledger (severity + evidence anchors)

| finding_id | Severity | Finding | Evidence anchors | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RT12-F001` | high | Earlier doc framing treated packet-local crates as placeholders/stubs despite implemented packet-local contract APIs. | `DOC-PASS-02.1`, `DOC-PASS-02.4`, `DOC-PASS-02.5`; `crates/fnp-iter/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-random/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-linalg/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-io/src/lib.rs` | corrected language in pass-12 precursor edits; contradiction now reframed as lane-integration debt, not implementation absence |

| `RT12-F003` | medium | Optional-path log appenders can weaken replay-complete evidence guarantees on gate-critical paths. | `DOC-PASS-10.4` (`ARCH-C003`), `DOC-PASS-11.4`; `crates/fnp-conformance/src/lib.rs` (`maybe_append_*`), `crates/fnp-conformance/src/workflow_scenarios.rs` (`maybe_append_workflow_log`) | open; require fail-closed required-log policy for gate-critical appenders |
| `RT12-F004` | medium | Runtime uses expected-loss calculus, but reliability gate escalation remains mostly threshold-based. | `DOC-PASS-11.3`, `DOC-PASS-11.5` (`SYN-C002`); `crates/fnp-runtime/src/lib.rs` (`expected_loss_*` fields), `crates/fnp-conformance/src/bin/run_*_gate.rs` | open; unify expected-loss escalation policy across gate binaries |
| `RT12-F005` | medium | Contradiction tracking is distributed across many pass sections without a single machine snapshot artifact. | `DOC-PASS-02.6`, `03.5`, `04.4`, `05.5`, `06.6`, `07.6`, `08.5`, `09.5`, `10.4`, `11.5` | open; add generated contradiction/sentinel snapshot artifact per gate cycle |

### DOC-PASS-12.2 Assertion traceability map (legacy anchors and executable evidence)

| assertion_id | Assertion under review | Legacy anchor(s) | Executable evidence anchor(s) | Traceability status |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| ID | Contradiction / unknown | Risk | Owner bead(s) | Closure criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RT12-C001` | Packet-local contract APIs are implemented, but readiness still lacks lane-complete differential + replay evidence for all packet-local domains. | high | `bd-23m.14.6/.7`, `bd-23m.18.6/.7`, `bd-23m.19.6/.7`, `bd-23m.20.6/.7` | each packet ships closed differential + workflow/e2e evidence and appears as green in readiness reports |

| `RT12-C003` | Expected-loss model is runtime-local; reliability governance does not yet consume it as primary escalation policy. | medium | `bd-23m.8`, `bd-23m.23` | gate retries/flake/coverage escalation includes expected-loss policy artifact and deterministic fallback trigger |
| `RT12-C004` | Contradiction registers are comprehensive but fragmented, preventing single-artifact trend/diff auditing. | medium | docs automation follow-up + `bd-23m.23` | emit versioned contradiction/sentinel snapshot artifact and wire it into CI/gate reports |

## DOC-PASS-14 Full-Agent Deep Dive Pass A (Structure Specialist)

### DOC-PASS-14.1 Canonical topology alias map (cross-doc coherence)

|---|---|---|---|---|
| semantic kernel | `L1` | `A1` | `crates/fnp-dtype/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-ndarray/src/lib.rs` | single source of truth for legality/promotion; execution may not redefine semantics |

### DOC-PASS-14.2 Structure-specialist findings ledger (adversarial)

| finding_id | Severity | Structural finding | Evidence anchors | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ST14-F001` | medium | Two equivalent layer ID vocabularies (`L*` vs `A*`) were undocumented as aliases, creating avoidable drift risk in future pass references. | `DOC-PASS-10.1` in both target docs | resolved in this pass via explicit alias map |
| `ST14-F002` | high | Layering/dependency law is documented but still lacks machine enforcement, so cross-layer violations can regress silently. | `DOC-PASS-10.4` (`ARCH-C001`), `DOC-PASS-01.5` (`TOPO-C003`), root `Cargo.toml` workspace graph | open; requires CI-level dependency-direction contract check |
| `ST14-F003` | high | Packet-local `L2/A2` domains remain structurally under-wired into `L4/L5` gate lanes despite clear ownership boundaries. | `DOC-PASS-09.2`, `DOC-PASS-11.4`, `DOC-PASS-12.3` | open; packet-local F/G/H/I lane closure required |
| `ST14-F004` | medium | Gate/replay command conventions were documented, but there was no single structure-level checklist proving each gate path is `rch`-offloaded and replay-deterministic. | `DOC-PASS-10.3`, `scripts/e2e/run_*_gate.sh`, `scripts/e2e/run_ci_gate_topology.sh`, `artifacts/contracts/ci_gate_topology_v1.json`, `crates/fnp-conformance/src/bin/run_test_contract_gate.rs` (`ci_gate_topology_contract`) | resolved by machine topology contract + enforced gate-order/command checks |

| `ST14-B002` | execution/semantic -> runtime policy (`L2/L1 -> L3`) | runtime decision API and policy fixture suites | packet-local paths are not uniformly represented in gate-level scenarios | packet F/G owners |
| `ST14-B003` | runtime/execution/semantic -> conformance (`L3/L2/L1 -> L4`) | conformance orchestrator suite wiring and fixture contracts | lane completeness varies by packet domain | packet + conformance owners |
| `ST14-B004` | conformance -> reliability envelope (`L4 -> L5`) | gate binaries consume suite summaries + diagnostics | topology checklist is now materialized and enforced via `artifacts/contracts/ci_gate_topology_v1.json` + `ci_gate_topology_contract` suite | `bd-23m.10`, `bd-23m.23` |

### DOC-PASS-14.5 Structure contradiction register with closure criteria

| ID | Contradiction / unknown | Risk | Owner bead(s) | Closure criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `ST14-C002` | Dependency-direction contract remains prose-only and can drift from actual workspace edges. | high | `bd-23m.23` + docs automation follow-up | CI emits explicit dependency-edge policy check and fails forbidden edges |

### DOC-PASS-15.1 Behavior findings ledger (adversarial)

| finding_id | Severity | Behavioral finding | Evidence anchors | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BH15-F001` | high | Runtime decision semantics include risk-threshold action routing, but packet-local policy validators (`fnp-io`, `fnp-linalg`) currently validate token legality only, not action selection; docs must keep these layers distinct. | `crates/fnp-runtime/src/lib.rs` (`decide_compatibility`), `crates/fnp-io/src/lib.rs` (`validate_io_policy_metadata`), `crates/fnp-linalg/src/lib.rs` (`validate_policy_metadata`) | resolved in docs by explicit layer separation; implementation integration remains open |
| `BH15-F002` | medium | Deterministic invariants are strong at crate level (SCE/ufunc/iter/random), but cross-packet differential/replay evidence remains uneven, so behavior confidence is non-uniform by domain. | `crates/fnp-ndarray/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-ufunc/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-iter/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fnp-random/src/lib.rs`; `DOC-PASS-12.3` | open; packet-local F/G lane completion required |

| known-compatible high-risk class | `allow` (compatibility-first) | `full_validate` when `risk_score >= threshold` | `crates/fnp-runtime/src/lib.rs` (`hardened_validation_threshold`) | coherent at runtime; packet-local docs must not over-claim this logic locally |
| known-incompatible / unknown class | `fail_closed` | `fail_closed` | runtime + packet-local metadata validators | coherent |
| packet-local metadata token validation | accepts known mode/class tokens, rejects unknown tokens | same | `validate_policy_metadata` in `fnp-linalg`/`fnp-io` | coherent but intentionally narrower than runtime action routing |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RPT16-P001` | baseline telemetry generation | `crates/fnp-conformance/src/benchmark.rs`, `artifacts/baselines/ufunc_benchmark_baseline*.json` | p50/p95/p99 + throughput/bandwidth metrics are reproducibly emitted | benchmark scope breadth still limited to selected workloads |

### DOC-PASS-16.4 Logging and durability contract checklist

| checklist_id | Contract requirement | Evidence anchor(s) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RPT16-K001` | replay-critical fields (`fixture_id`, `seed`, `mode`, `env_fingerprint`, `artifact_refs`, `reason_code`) are mandatory for policy/adversarial/workflow fixtures | `crates/fnp-conformance/src/test_contracts.rs`, `crates/fnp-conformance/src/lib.rs` (`normalize_*`) | strong |

### DOC-PASS-16.5 Risk/perf/test contradiction register with closure criteria

| ID | Contradiction / unknown | Risk | Owner bead(s) | Closure criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RPT16-C001` | Reliability gates are mature, but packet-local differential/replay lanes remain incomplete and dominate residual release risk. | high | `bd-23m.14.6/.7`, `bd-23m.18.6/.7`, `bd-23m.19.6/.7`, `bd-23m.20.6/.7` | packet-local F/G lanes are green and referenced in readiness reports |
| `RPT16-C002` | Expected-loss remains runtime-local; gate escalation is still threshold-led. | medium | `bd-23m.8`, `bd-23m.23` | gate diagnostics include expected-loss policy artifact and deterministic fallback trigger |
| `RPT16-C003` | Performance governance has strong artifacts but lacks machine-enforced EV gate + rollback automation. | medium | `bd-23m.8`, `bd-23m.10` | CI emits EV score and auto-fails when EV/rollback conditions are violated |

## 2. Quantitative Legacy Inventory (Measured)

- Total files: `2326`
- Python: `493`
- Native: `c=180`, `cpp=29`, `h=227`, `hpp=16`
- Cython: `pyx=13`, `pxd=6`
- Test-like files: `530`

High-density zones:
- `numpy/_core/src` (402 files)
- `numpy/typing/tests` (149)
- `numpy/f2py/tests` (132)
- `numpy/_core/tests` (100)
- `numpy/linalg/lapack_lite` (26)
- `numpy/random/src` (37)

## 3. Subsystem Extraction Matrix (Legacy -> Rust)

| Legacy locus | Non-negotiable behavior to preserve | Target crates | Primary oracles | Phase-2 extraction deliverables |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `numpy/_core/src/multiarray/shape.c` + `shape.h` | shape legality, stride legality, reshape semantics | `fnp-ndarray` | `_core/tests/test_shape_base.py`, `test_nditer.py` | shape/stride state machine, invalid-transition matrix |
| `dtypemeta.c`, `descriptor.c`, `can_cast_table.h` | promotion and cast determinism | `fnp-dtype` | `_core/tests/test_dtype.py`, `test_casting*` | promotion matrix, cast allow/deny table |
| `dtype_transfer.c`, `lowlevel_strided_loops.c.src` | assignment loop correctness under strides | `fnp-iter`, `fnp-ufunc` | `_core/tests/test_mem_overlap.py` | alias/overlap safety matrix, loop invariants |
| `umath/ufunc_object.c`, dispatch loop sources | ufunc dispatch and broadcasting precedence | `fnp-ufunc` | `_core/tests/test_ufunc.py`, `test_overrides.py` | dispatch precedence graph, override semantics spec |
| `multiarray/nditer*` | iterator consistency across order/layout | `fnp-iter` | `_core/tests/test_nditer.py` | traversal equivalence ledger |
| `numpy/random/*.pyx` + `random/src/*` | RNG determinism and state serialization | `fnp-random` | `random/tests/*` | RNG stream fixture corpus + state schema |
| `numpy/linalg/lapack_lite/*` | solver shape/tolerance/return semantics | `fnp-linalg` | `linalg/tests/test_linalg.py` | BLAS/LAPACK boundary contract table |
| `numpy/lib/stride_tricks.py` + IO paths | view tricks and npy/npz metadata semantics | `fnp-ndarray`, `fnp-io` | `lib/tests/test_stride_tricks.py`, IO tests | metadata parser/state machine spec |

## 4. Alien-Artifact Invariant Ledger (Formal Obligations)

- `FNP-I1` Shape legality closure: all produced array states satisfy dimension/stride legality.
- `FNP-I2` Promotion determinism: scoped dtype pairs map to a single canonical result dtype.
- `FNP-I3` Broadcast determinism: result shape is deterministic and independent of iteration schedule.
- `FNP-I4` Alias safety: write operations do not violate overlap semantics.
- `FNP-I5` RNG reproducibility: fixed seed and algorithm produce stable output stream.

Required proof artifacts per implemented slice:
1. invariant statement,
2. executable witness fixtures,
3. failing counterexample archive (if any),
4. remediation proof.

## 5. Native/C/Fortran Boundary Register

| Boundary | Files | Risk | Mandatory mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| ndarray metadata core | `multiarray/*.c` | critical | legality checks first, then loop execution |
| ufunc dispatch core | `umath/ufunc_object.c` | high | precedence fixtures + override differential tests |
| lapack-lite bridge | `linalg/lapack_lite/*` | high | solver IO/tolerance conformance fixtures |
| RNG backend | `random/src/*`, `random/*.pyx` | high | deterministic stream and state round-trip checks |

## 6. Compatibility and Security Doctrine (Mode-Split)

Decision law (runtime):
`mode + metadata_contract + risk_score + budget -> allow | full_validate | fail_closed`

| Threat | Strict mode | Hardened mode | Required ledger artifact |
|---|---|---|---|
| malformed npy/npz metadata | fail-closed | fail-closed with bounded diagnostics | parser incident ledger |
| shape bomb payload | execute in scoped limits | tighter admission caps | admission guard report |
| unsafe cast attempt | reject unscoped cast | allow only policy-allowlisted cast | cast decision ledger |
| stride alias confusion | reject invalid transitions | reject invalid transitions | stride invariant report |
| unknown incompatible metadata version | fail-closed | fail-closed | compatibility drift report |

## 7. Conformance Program (Exhaustive First Wave)

### 7.1 Fixture families

1. Shape/reshape fixtures
2. Stride/view and overlap fixtures
3. Broadcast fixtures
4. Ufunc arithmetic/reduction fixtures
5. Dtype promotion fixtures
6. RNG determinism fixtures
7. NPY/NPZ IO fixtures

### 7.2 Differential harness outputs (fnp-conformance)

Each run emits:
- machine-readable parity report,
- mismatch class histogram,
- minimized repro fixture bundle,
- strict/hardened divergence report.

Release gate rule: critical-family drift => hard fail.

## 8. Extreme Optimization Program

Primary hotspots:
- ufunc dispatch path
- non-contiguous iteration loops
- dtype conversion hot loops
- reduction kernels

Budgets (from spec section 17):
- broadcast p95 <= 180 ms
- reductions p95 <= 210 ms
- reshape/view p95 <= 40 ms
- npy parse throughput >= 400 MB/s
- p99 regression <= +7%, peak RSS regression <= +8%

Optimization governance:
1. baseline,
2. profile,
3. single optimization lever,
4. conformance proof,
5. budget gate,
6. evidence commit.

## 9. RaptorQ-Everywhere Artifact Contract

Durable artifacts requiring RaptorQ sidecars:
- conformance fixture bundles,
- benchmark baselines,
- promotion/cast ledgers,
- risk/proof ledgers.

Required envelope fields:
- source hash,
- symbol manifest,
- scrub status,
- decode proof chain.

## 10. Phase-2 Execution Backlog (Concrete)

1. Extract shape/stride legality rules from `shape.c`.
2. Extract promotion/cast tables from dtype sources.
3. Extract overlap/alias rules from low-level loop code.
4. Extract ufunc dispatch precedence and override rules.
5. Extract NDIter traversal invariants.
6. Extract RNG state schema and deterministic stream behavior.
7. Extract linalg solver input/output and tolerance behavior.
8. Extract npy/npz metadata parsing state machine.
9. Build first differential fixture corpus for items 1-8.
10. Implement mismatch taxonomy in `fnp-conformance`.
11. Add strict/hardened divergence reporting.
12. Attach RaptorQ sidecar generation and decode-proof validation.

Definition of done for Phase-2:
- each row in section 3 has extraction artifacts,
- all seven fixture families are runnable,
- G1-G6 gates from comprehensive spec map to concrete harness outputs.

## 11. Residual Gaps and Risks

- `PROPOSED_ARCHITECTURE.md` crate list contains literal `\n` separators; normalize before automation.
- high-risk native boundaries (multiarray/umath/lapack-lite) require wider differential corpus before aggressive optimization.
- RNG and cast semantics are common silent-regression vectors and require explicit release blockers.

## 12. Deep-Pass Hotspot Inventory (Measured)

Measured from `/data/projects/franken_numpy/legacy_numpy_code/numpy`:
- file count: `2326`
- highest concentration: `numpy/_core` (`604` files), `numpy/f2py` (`177`), `numpy/typing` (`152`), `numpy/random` (`101`), `numpy/lib` (`97`)

Top source hotspots by line count (first-wave extraction anchors):
1. `numpy/linalg/lapack_lite/f2c_d_lapack.c` (`41864`)
2. `numpy/linalg/lapack_lite/f2c_s_lapack.c` (`41691`)
3. `numpy/linalg/lapack_lite/f2c_z_lapack.c` (`29996`)
4. `numpy/linalg/lapack_lite/f2c_c_lapack.c` (`29861`)
5. `numpy/linalg/lapack_lite/f2c_blas.c` (`21603`)
6. `numpy/_core/src/umath/ufunc_object.c` (`6796`)

Interpretation:
- low-level shape/ufunc/cast paths must be extracted before high-level wrappers,
- lapack-lite bridge dominates numerical backend complexity,
- iterator/transfer semantics remain highest silent-regression risk.

## 13. Phase-2C Extraction Payload Contract (Per Ticket)

Each `FNP-P2C-*` ticket MUST produce:
1. type inventory (dtype/array/iterator structs and fields),
2. shape-stride legality rules with exact conditions,
3. cast/promotion rule tables (including defaults),
4. error/diagnostic contract map,
5. alias/overlap/memory-order behavior ledger,
6. strict/hardened mode split,
7. explicit exclusion ledger,
8. fixture mapping manifest,
9. optimization candidate notes + isomorphism risk,
10. RaptorQ artifact declarations.

Artifact location (normative):
- `artifacts/phase2c/FNP-P2C-00X/legacy_anchor_map.md`

Packet acceptance budgets:
- strict mode critical drift budget: `0`
- strict mode non-critical drift budget: `<= 0.10%`
- hardened mode divergence budget: `<= 1.00%` and only allowlisted defensive cases

3. one lever,
4. conformance + invariant proof,
5. re-baseline.

Primary sentinel workloads:

- ufunc dispatch stress (`FNP-P2C-005`),
- RNG reproducibility workloads (`FNP-P2C-007`).

Optimization scoring gate:
`score = (impact * confidence) / effort`, merge only if `score >= 2.0`.

## 16. RaptorQ Evidence Topology and Recovery Drills

Durable artifacts requiring sidecars:
- parity reports,
- fixture corpora,
- cast/promotion ledgers,
- benchmark baselines,
- strict/hardened divergence logs.

Naming convention:
- payload: `packet_<id>_<artifact>.json`
- sidecar: `packet_<id>_<artifact>.raptorq.json`
- proof: `packet_<id>_<artifact>.decode_proof.json`

Decode-proof failure policy: hard blocker for packet promotion.

## 17. Phase-2C Exit Checklist (Operational)

Phase-2C is complete only when:
1. `FNP-P2C-001..009` artifacts exist and pass schema validation.
2. Every packet has strict and hardened fixture coverage.
3. Drift budgets from section 14 are met.
4. At least one hotspot optimization proof exists for each high-risk packet.
5. RaptorQ sidecars + decode proofs are scrub-clean.
6. Remaining risks are explicit with owners and next actions.
