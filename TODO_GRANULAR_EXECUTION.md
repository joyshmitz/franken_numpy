## 6. Validation and Quality Gates

- [x] `cargo fmt --check`
- [x] `cargo check --all-targets`
- [x] `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- [x] `cargo test --workspace`
- [x] `cargo test -p fnp-conformance -- --nocapture`
- [x] `cargo bench`

### 6.1 Validation Notes
- [x] Initial `cargo test --workspace` run caught one failing test:
  - `raptorq_artifacts::tests::sidecar_roundtrip_scrub_is_ok`
- [x] Applied fix in `crates/fnp-conformance/src/raptorq_artifacts.rs`:
  - recovery drill now scans deterministic drop candidates and prefers the first candidate that proves successful recovery
- [x] Re-ran full gate sequence after fix; all commands passed
- [x] `cargo bench` completed successfully; no dedicated benchmark targets are yet defined, so unit tests were run in bench profile with all tests ignored

## 7. Landing-The-Plane Checklist

- [x] Confirm no destructive operations were executed
- [x] Summarize all changes and rationale
- [x] List residual risks and highest-value next steps
- [x] Confirm method-stack artifacts produced or explicitly deferred with reason

### 7.1 Residual Risks (Captured)
- [x] Oracle source now uses `system` NumPy (via local `uv` Python 3.14 venv), but parity is not yet anchored to the vendored legacy NumPy runtime path.
- [x] `cargo bench` gate passes but workspace does not yet expose dedicated `[[bench]]` targets; benchmark evidence currently comes from `generate_benchmark_baseline` artifact pipeline.
- [x] Ufunc coverage currently scoped to arithmetic binary ops + `sum` reductions; broader NumPy API surface remains open for subsequent parity waves.

### 7.2 Highest-Value Next Steps (Captured)
- [x] Add dedicated criterion benchmark targets and wire regression thresholds.
- [x] Expand oracle corpus to larger shape, dtype-promotion, NaN/Inf, and aliasing/view edge cases.
- [x] Run capture pipeline against legacy NumPy runtime once local environment can import `legacy_numpy_code/numpy`.
- [x] Continue port wave into planned crates (`fnp-fft`, `fnp-random` full API, `fnp-linalg` parity expansion) with the same differential + durability artifact pattern.

## 8. Post-Landing Follow-On (This Session)

### 8.1 Real NumPy environment enablement
- [x] Create local `uv` venv with Python 3.14 (`.venv-numpy314`)
- [x] Install NumPy in local venv
- [x] Re-run oracle capture against real NumPy runtime (`oracle_source=system`)

### 8.2 Oracle runtime robustness
- [x] Fix dtype alias mismatch in capture script (`f64` -> `float64`, etc.) so real NumPy capture succeeds
- [x] Add explicit interpreter override env var support (`FNP_ORACLE_PYTHON`) with `python3` fallback
- [x] Improve capture failure diagnostics to include selected interpreter path/name

### 8.3 Validation after follow-on changes
- [x] Re-run `capture_numpy_oracle` with explicit venv interpreter override
- [x] Re-run `run_ufunc_differential` (green: 7/7)
- [x] Re-run `cargo test -p fnp-conformance` (green)
- [x] Re-run `cargo fmt --check` (green)
